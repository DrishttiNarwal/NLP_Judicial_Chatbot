Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi had received a request for enhancement of original pecuniary jurisdiction of District Courts of Delhi from the existing Rs. 20 lakh to Rs. 2 crore from the Coordination Committee of All Bar Associations of Delhi.
Government of National Capital Territory considered this request and observed that increasing the pecuniary jurisdiction would lessen the burden on High Court and there would be substantive improvement in disposal of cases in subordinate courts, since number of subordinate Courts has now increased due to creation of eleven Districts in Delhi.  Enhancement of pecuniary jurisdiction of Delhi District Courts will facilitate access of general public to the District Courts within the vicinity of their location.  Moreover, this would also be helpful to litigants in providing “Justice at Doorstep” due to the location of District Courts in different parts of Delhi.
The proposal received from the Govt. of NCT of Delhi seeking amendments in the Delhi High Court Act, 1966 to provide for enhancing the pecuniary limits of the District Courts of Delhi from the existing Rs.20 lakhs to Rs.2 crore was examined and a Bill viz., The Delhi High Court (Amendment) Bill, 2015 was introduced in the Parliament. The said Bill was considered and passed by both the Houses of Parliament. The Bill received the assent of the President President of India on 10.08.2015 and has been brought into force w.e.f.26.10.2015.
Increasing the pecuniary jurisdiction of district Courts of Delhi would lessen the burden of Delhi High Court and there would be substantive improvement in disposal of cases in subordinate Courts. This will facilitate access of the general public to 11 District Courts located in 6 District Court Complexes within the vicinity of their location, ensuring speedy justice to the litigants at their door steps.

Article 348(1) of the Constitution of India provides that all proceedings in the Supreme Court and in every High Court shall be in English language until Parliament by law otherwise provides.
Article 348 (2) provides that the Governor of the State may, with the previous consent of the President, authorize the use of the Hindi language or any other language used for any official purpose of the State, in the proceedings of the High Court having its principal seat in that State provided that decrees, judgments or orders passed by such High Courts shall be in English. The Official Language Act, 1963 reiterates this and provides under Section 7 that the use of Hindi or official language of a State in addition to the English language may be authorized, with the consent of the President of India, by the Governor of the State for the purpose of judgments, decrees etc. made by the High Court for that State. No law has been made in this regard by the Parliament so far. Therefore, English continues to be the language for all the proceedings of the Supreme Court.
The 18th Law Commission of India in its 216th Report on “Non-Feasibility of Introduction of Hindi as Compulsory Language in the Supreme Court of India” (2008) has, after detailed discussions with all stake-holders, inter-alia, recommended that the higher judiciary should not be subjected to any kind of even persuasive change in the present societal context. The Government has accepted the stand of the Commission.
The use of Hindi has been authorized long back in the proceedings as well in the judgments, decrees or orders in the High Courts of the States of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Government of India had received proposals from the Government of Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal and Karnataka to permit use of Tamil, Gujarati, Hindi, Bengali and Kannada in the proceedings of the Madras High Court, Gujarat High Court, Chhattisgarh High Court, Calcutta High Court and Karnataka High Court respectively. The advice of the Chief Justice of India was sought on these proposals as per a decision of Cabinet Committee taken in 1965 which provides that comments of the Chief Justice of India are necessary before considering any proposal for use of Hindi or any Regional language in the proceedings of a High Court. The Chief Justice of India vide his d.o. dated 16.10.2012 intimated that the Full Court, after due deliberations, decided not to accept the proposals. The Government has abided by the decision of the Supreme Court.
Based on another request from the Government of Tamil Nadu, the Government requested the Chief Justice of India to review the earlier decisions in this regard vide. letter dated 04.07.2014 and convey the consent of the Supreme Court of India. Hon’ble the Chief Justice of India vide his d.o. letter dated 18.01.2016 conveyed that the Full Court, after extensive deliberations disapproved the proposal and reiterated the earlier decisions of the Hon’ble Court.

Championing the cause of safety and security of women and girl child, the Government provided for stringent punishment including death penalty for perpetrators of rape by passing the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2018. Incidents of sexual offences and prolonged trials of accused necessitated dedicated court machinery to provide immediate relief to the victims. Since October 2019, the Department of Justice is implementing a Centrally Sponsored Scheme, to set up Fast Track Special Courts (FTSCs) including exclusive POCSO Courts across the nation for expeditious trial relating to sexual offences. Each court comprises of 1 Judicial Officer and 7 Staff Members. Out of 31 States and UTs eligible, 30 have joined this scheme. Puducherry made a special request to join the Scheme and the one exclusive POCSO Court was operationalized in May, 2023.
The Scheme was initially for a period of one year spread over two Financial Years 2019-20 and 2020-21 at a total outlay of Rs. 767.25 Cr. with Rs. 474 Cr. as Central Share to be met from Nirbhaya Fund. The Cabinet approved the continuation of the Scheme for two years i.e. up to March, 2023 with a total budgetary outlay of Rs. 1572.86 Cr. with Rs.971.70 Cr. as central share.

“The Doing Business Report* was the flagship publication of the World Bank Group that benchmarked business regulations in 191 economies on 10 areas of business regulation such as: Starting a Business, Dealing with Construction Permits, Getting Electricity, Registering Property, Getting Credit, Protecting Minority Investors, Paying Taxes,Trading across Borders, Enforcing Contracts, and Resolving Insolvency.
The Ease of Doing Business (EoDB) index was a ranking system established bythe World Bank Group wherein the ‘higher rankings’ (a lower numerical value)indicated better and usually simpler regulations for businesses and strongerprotections of property rights.The Ease Of Doing Business Score showed an economy’s absolute positionrelative to the best regulatory performance, whereas the ease of doing businessranking was an indication of an economy’s position relative to that of othereconomies.
The Enforcing Contracts indicator measured the time and cost for the resolution of a standardized commercial dispute as well as a series of good practices in the judiciary. Therefore, Time, Cost and Quality of Judicial Process were the three variables which the World Bank had taken into account for ranking the countries on the Enforcing Contracts parameter of the Ease of Doing Business Ranking. Only Delhi and Mumbai were under the purview of the Ease of Doing Business survey by World Bank.
The Department of Justice is the nodal department for the Enforcing Contracts Indicator. The Government of India has been aggressively pursuing various reform measures to create an effective, efficient, transparent and robust ‘Contract Enforcement Regime’. Several rounds of meetings have been held with the judicial and legal fraternity, educational institutions, leading law firms, corporate bodies, etc. to work in an integrated manner to improve the quality and efficiency of commercial courts.
The ‘Doing Business Report’ by World Bank Group has been discontinued. The World Bank is working on a new and more comprehensive framework called Business-Ready for assessing the business and investment climate in economies worldwide.
The data for the Ease of Doing Business rankings was collected by a combination of study of the codes of civil procedure, court regulations as well as questionnaires survey by local litigation lawyers and judges.

The Overall Rank of India in the Doing Business Report 2015 was 142 out of 190 economies. The rank improved to 63rd Position in the Doing Business Report 2020 released in October 2019. This was a significant improvement of 79 positions from the Doing Business Report 2015. In Enforcing Contracts indicator, India achieved 163rd position in the Doing Business Report 2020, an improvement of 23 positions from the 186th rank in the Doing Business Report 2015.

https://doj.gov.in/phase-iii/,"The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the eCourts Project Phase III as a Central Sector Scheme spanning four years (2023 onwards) with financial outlay of Rs.7210 crore.
In line with the vision of Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji’s “Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas and Sabka Vishwas”, eCourts Mission Mode Project is the prime mover for improving access to justice using technology. As part of the National eGovernance Plan, the e-Courts Project is under implementation since 2007 for ICT enablement of the Indian Judiciary the Phase II of which has concluded in 2023. Phase III of the e-Courts Project in India is rooted in philosophy of “access and inclusion”.
Taking the gains of Phase-I and Phase-II to the next level, the e-Courts Phase-III aims to usher in a regime of maximum ease of justice by moving towards digital, online and paperless courts through digitization of the entire court records including legacy records and by bringing in universalization of e-Filing/ e-Payments through saturation of all court complexes with e-Sewa Kendras. It will put in place intelligent smart systems enabling data-based decision making for judges and registries while scheduling or prioritizing cases. The main objective of the Phase-III is to create a unified technology platform for the judiciary, which will provide a seamless and paperless interface between the courts, the litigants and other stakeholders.
The Central Sector Scheme of eCourts Phase III is being implemented under the joint partnership of Department of Justice, Ministry of Law & Justice, Government of India and eCommittee, Supreme Court of India, in a decentralized manner through the respective High Courts to develop a judicial system that would promote ease of justice by making the system more accessible, affordable, reliable, predictable, and transparent for all stakeholders.
Components of eCourts Phase III are as follows:-
The expected outcomes of the scheme are as follows:
Citizens who do not have access to technology can access the judicial services from eSewa Kendras, thus bridging the digital divide
Digitization of court records lays the foundation for all other digital services in the project. It enables processes to become more environmental friendly by minimizing paper-based filings and reducing the physical movement of documents.
Virtual participation in the court proceedings thus reducing costs associated with court proceedings, such as travel expenses for witnesses, judges, and other stakeholders.
Payment of court fees, fines and penalties from anywhere, anytime.
Expansion of eFiling for reducing the time and effort required to file documents. Thereby minimizing human errors as documents are automatically checked and also prevent further creation of paper based records.
Use of latest technologies like AI and its subsets Machine Learning (ML), Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Natural Language Processing (NLP) to provide a smoother user experience by building a “smart” ecosystem. Registries will have less data entry and minimal file scrutiny facilitating better decision-making and policy planning. It envisages smart scheduling, intelligent system that enables data-based decision making for judges and registries, allows for greater predictability and optimisation of the capacity of judges and lawyers.
Expansion of virtual courts beyond the adjudication of traffic violation cases, thereby eliminating the presence of litigant or lawyer in the court.
Enhanced accuracy and transparency in court proceedings
Emphasis on automated delivery of court summons by further expanding the NSTEP (National Serving and Tracking of Electronic Processes), hence drastically reducing the delays in trials.
Use of emerging technologies in court processes will make them more efficient and effective, hence contributing significantly towards the reduction of pendency cases.

The Wide Area Network (WAN) Project under eCourts project is aimed at connecting all District and Subordinate court complexes, spread across the country using various technologies like OFC, RF, VSAT. So far, 2977 sites have been commissioned out of 2992 sites with 10 Mbps to 100 Mbps bandwidth speed (completing 99.5% sites). This forms the backbone for the eCourts project ensuring data connectivity in courts across the length and breadth of the country.
Many courts under the eCourts project are located in far flung areas, termed as Technically Not Feasible (TNF) sites, where terrestrial cable cannot be used. These sites are being connected using alternative means like RF, VSAT, Submarine cable etc. In the COVID-19 scenario, this WAN connectivity enabled better Video Conferencing facilities and improved access to justice.

Case Information Software (CIS) which forms the basis for the e court services is based on customized Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) which has been developed by NIC.Currently, CIS National Core Version 3.2 is being implemented in District Courts and the CIS National Core Version 1.0 is being implemented for the High Courts.
Every single case has been provided a Unique Identification code which is called CNR number and QR Code. This has led to the development of National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG) as a new communication pipeline for judicial data transmission
To ensure smooth functioning of Courts during COVID-19 pandemic, a new software patch has been developed to help in smart scheduling of cases.Courts can now hear urgent cases in scheduled time slots and accommodate the convenience of lawyers to prevent conflicting engagements and has proved to be effective in managing overcrowding in court premises.

National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG) is a database of orders, judgments and case details of 18,735 District & Subordinate Courts and High Courts created as an online platform under the eCourts Project. Data is updated on a near real-time basis by the connected District and Taluka courts. It provides data relating to judicial proceedings/decisions of all computerized district and subordinate courts of the country. All High Courts have also joined the National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG) through web services, providing easy access facility to the litigant public.
Through the eCourts services platform using elastic search technology, currently litigants can access case status information in respect of over 26.35 crore cases and more than 27.06 crore orders / judgments pertaining to these computerized courts as on 02.09.2024. On 14.09.2023, Supreme Court of India has onboarded its data on National Judicial Data Grid.
Case data is available on NJDG for both civil and criminal cases with the ability to perform drill-down analysis based on the age of the case as well as the State and District.
NJDG works as a monitoring tool to identify, manage & reduce pendency of cases. It helps to provide timely inputs for making policy decisions to reduce delays in disposing of cases and helps in reducing case pendency. It also facilitates better monitoring of court performance and systemic bottlenecks, and, thus, serves as an efficient resource management tool. To track cases related to land disputes, Land Records data of 26 States have been linked with NJDG.
World Bank praised the National Judicial Data Grid in the Ease of Doing Business report for 2018, that it made possible to generate case management reports, thereby making it easier to enforce contracts.
In consonance with the National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy (NDSAP) announced by the Government of India, Open Application Programming Interface (API) has been provided to the Central & State Government to allow easy access to the NJDG data using a departmental ID and access key. This will allow the institutional litigants to access the NJDG data for their evaluation and monitoring purposes. It is proposed to expand the facility to non-institutional litigants as well in future.
Recently, reasons for delay have been included in NJDG. The inclusion of feature specifying the reasons for delay on the NJDG portal has the potential to keep a proper track on issues which the judiciary faces while adjudicating cases and consequently enables them and the decision makers to take various steps in the direction of redressing the burgeoning pendency of cases. Apart from that, individual reason for delay highlights the problems at a granular level, which otherwise would be cumbersome to be tracked upon and thereby remedied. 
* Data for October 2024 will be updated, once the migration on new NJDG portal is complete.

A novel concept of virtual courts has been introduced under the eCourts project to deal with petty traffic offence cases. The concept is aimed at reducing footfalls in the courts by eliminating the physical presence of violator or advocate in the court. Virtual court can be managed by virtual judge whose jurisdiction can be extended to entire state and working hours may be 24X7. Neither litigant need to come to court nor judge will have to physically preside over the court. Thus, precious judicial time and manpower will be saved.
As on 31.08.2024, there are 28 such courts in 21 States / UTs viz. Delhi (2), Haryana, Chandigarh, Gujarat (2), Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala (2), Maharashtra (2), Assam, Chhattisgarh, Jammu and Kashmir (2), Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Meghalaya, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand (2), Madhya Pradesh, Tripura, West Bengal, Rajasthan and Manipur (2).
Facility is provided for Litigants to file the plaint electronically through e-Filing and pay the Court Fees or Fine online through pay.ecourts.gov.in. Litigant can view the status of the case also online through various channels created for service delivery hence the entire exercise can be done sitting at home. Over 5.62 crore cases (5,62,62,766) have been handled by 28 virtual courts and in more than 59 lakhs (59,66,462) cases, online fine of more than Rs. 612.81 crores have been realized till 31.08.2024.

e-Filing of cases requires the option for electronic payment of fees which includes court fees, fines and penalties which are directly payable to the Consolidated Fund. Online payment of court fees, fines, penalties and judicial deposits has been initiated through https://pay.ecourts.gov.in from 14th August 2018. Introduction of electronic collection of court fees and other civil payments requires appropriate amendments in the existing Court Fees Act enacted by the various State Governments besides opening a bank account in a Nationalized Bank or in other bank suitable to receive, hold and disburse such payments electronically.
DoJ has taken up the matter with Chief Secretaries and Registrar General of High Courts to expedite the enactment / modification in existing enactment to enable epayment of court fees. The eCommittee of the Supreme Court has also proposed that since the existing Court Fees Act provides for refunds, administrative instructions may be issued by High Courts to allow one-time lump sum deposit as court fees which can be adjusted and balance refunded at the end of the proceedings in the same manner that court fees in respect of proceedings withdrawn or compromise are refunded in part.
A total of 22 High Courts have implemented ePayments in their respective jurisdictions whereas the Court Fees Act has been amended in 24 High Courts till 31.08.2024.
The ePayments can be enabled through an electronic payment process like SBI ePay, GRAS, e-GRAS, JeGRAS, HimKosh etc.Apart from payments being made through credit / debit cards and bank transfers, other applications like BHIM App, RuPay etc. can also be leveraged along with private wallets like Paytm, Google Pay etc.

Article 39A of the Constitution of India provides for free legal aid to the poor and weaker sections of the society and ensures justice for all. Articles 14 and 22(1) of the Constitution also make it obligatory for the State to ensure equality before law and a legal system which promotes justice on the basis of equal opportunity to all. In the year
1987, the Legal Services Authorities Act was enacted by the Parliament which came into force on 9th November, 1995 to establish a nationwide uniform network for providing free and competent legal services to the weaker sections of the society on the basis of equal opportunity. The National Legal Services Authority (NALSA) has been constituted under the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987 to monitor and evaluate implementation of legal aid programmes and to lay down policies and principles for making legal services available under the Act.
In every State, a State Legal Services Authority and in every High Court, a High Court Legal Services Committee have been constituted. District Legal Services Authorities, Taluk Legal Services Committees have been constituted in the Districts and most of the Taluks to give effect to the policies and directions of the NALSA and to provide free legal services to the people and conduct Lok Adalats in the State.
Supreme Court Legal Services Committee has been constituted to administer and implement the legal services programme insofar as it relates to the Supreme Court of India.
NALSA lays down policies, principles, guidelines and frames effective and economical schemes for the State Legal Services Authorities to implement the Legal Services Programmes throughout the country.
Primarily, the State Legal Services Authorities, District Legal Services Authorities, Taluk Legal Services Committees, etc. have been asked to discharge the following main functions on regular basis:
The Free Legal Services include:-
Lok Adalat is one of the Alternative Disputes Resolution Mechanisms. It is a forum where the disputes/cases pending in the court of law or at pre-litigation stage are settled/compromised amicably. The Lok Adalat has been given statutory status under the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987. Under this Act, an award made by a Lok Adalat is deemed to be a decree of a civil court and is final and binding on all parties and no appeal lies against thereto before any court.
As a part of the preventive and strategic legal aid, NALSA through the State Legal Services Authorities, conduct legal literacy programmes. In some States, Legal Literacy Programmes are conducted every year in schools and colleges and also for empowerment of women in a routine manner, besides the rural legal literacy camps.

Samvidhan Katta: – A celebration of Indian constitution through Dialogue and Awareness. As India approaches its 75th Republic Day, the Department of Justice, Ministry of Law & Justice has launched a significant initiative “Samvidhan Katta”, a celebration of Indian constitution through Dialogue and Awareness under the banner of “Hamara Samvidhan, Hamara Samman.” This campaign, rooted in the very essence of our constitutional values, seeks to foster a deeper understanding and appreciation of the Indian Constitution among citizens. “Samvidhan Katta,” is designed to encourage dialogue and discussion about the Constitution, its principles, and its impact on the lives of the people of India.
“Samvidhan Katta” is a unique platform where individuals from all walks of life—students, scholars, legal professionals, and common citizens—come together to engage in meaningful conversations about the Constitution. The term “Katta,” as used by Hon’ble Chief Justice of India- Dr. D.Y Chandrachud in the 2nd regional event held at Bikaner, Rajasthan. It is often associated with informal gatherings in Marathi language. It represents a space for open dialogue, where ideas and opinions can be freely exchanged. The objective of these sessions is to demystify the Constitution, making it accessible to everyone, and to highlight its role as a living document that protects the rights and liberties of all citizens. The Indian Constitution is not just a legal document; it is a charter of liberty and justice, enshrining the values of equality, dignity, and non-discrimination.
The Department of Justice (DoJ) by this flagship event aims to push forward for the creation of Samvidhan Katta groups by providing resources, guides, and discussion materials. Whether it’s a small group of friends, a classroom, or a community center, any space can become a Samvidhan Katta.
Join the movement, initiate your own Samvidhan Katta, share your stories, and contribute to embedding constitutional values deeply into our society’s fabric
Indra Sawhney v. Union of India (1992): Commonly known as the Mandal Commission case, this landmark judgment upheld the reservation policy for Other Backward Classes (OBCs) in government jobs. The Supreme Court recognized that affirmative action is essential to address historical injustices faced by marginalized communities and to ensure their participation in public life, thereby reinforcing the constitutional mandate of equality.
Vishaka v. State of Rajasthan (1997): This case was a watershed moment in addressing gender discrimination and harassment in the workplace. The Supreme Court laid down guidelines, known as the Vishaka Guidelines, to prevent sexual harassment at the workplace, thereby protecting the dignity and safety of women. These guidelines were eventually codified into the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition, and Redressal) Act, 2013.
Navtej Singh Johar v. Union of India (2018): This landmark judgment decriminalized consensual same-sex relations, striking down Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code. The Supreme Court affirmed the constitutional right to equality, dignity, and privacy, thereby providing a significant victory for the LGBTQ+ community and challenging societal norms of discrimination.
Indian Young Lawyers Association v. State of Kerala (2018): In this case, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of allowing women of all ages to enter the Sabarimala Temple, striking down a centuries-old custom that barred women of menstruating age from entering the temple. The judgment was a significant step towards gender equality and non-discrimination based on gender and biological factors.
