****Sex Determination is an Offence
Chila and Khandang were the best of
friends. Both of them studied together and
grew up together. One day Chila was
engaged to get married. On hearing this
news, Khandang had mixed feelings. She
was happy as well as sad. She was happy
because her friend is going to be settled and
sad because both of them have to part from
each other owing to their upcoming new
lives.
1Within a few days Chila got married.
Whenever Chila visited her maternal home,
both Chila and Khandang used to talk for
hours. Within their talks, Chila described her
new family to Khandang while Khandang
described the recent happenings in the
village, the crops in the field and the
threshing place.
A year later, Chila came to her maternal
home for maternal care. This time she was
going to stay for a longer duration.
Khandang was delighted at this. She often
came to visit Chila.
Chila was soon blessed with a beautiful
daughter. However, her in-laws seemed a
bit unhappy. On the other side, Khandang
was extremely happy. To celebrate her
happiness, Khandang prepared some
2laddoos (sweets) and took them to the
hospital and distributed them to everyone.
Looking at this, Khandang’s mother told
Chila, “Chila, without you Khandang
becomes very depressed but whenever you
are by her side she gleams with happiness.
Why don’t you look for a suitable groom for
her and take her to your village? Thereafter,
both of you can always be together.”
3Fate took such a turn that Khandang too
got married to a person from the same
village as that of Chila. Both of them were
extremely happy. However, happiness was
not there for long. There were a lot of
restrictions in the house of the in-laws of
Khandang. She was not allowed to meet
anyone or go out of the house. Khandang
often wondered as to when she will be able
to meet Chila.
4One day both Chila and Khandang met
each other in the Church. There, both of
them decided that they will meet each other
in the Church every Sunday evening. Both
of them, then, eagerly waited for Sunday
and when they met at the Church, they
talked on a variety of topics.
One Sunday evening, when both of them
met in the Church, both of them looked sad.
Unlike the other days, both of them did not
look happy. Both of them sat at the steps of
the Church and Chila told Khandang,
“Khandang, I have something to tell you.”
“Something is also troubling me too,
Chila” said Khandang.
“Troubling you? What is troubling you?”
asked Chila.
Khandang said, “First you. Let me know
what you want to tell.”
5Chila replied, “No, first you. I would like
to solve your problem first. Tell me what is
troubling you?”
Khandang then replied, “This ‘you first’,
‘you first’ will finally lead us to the time when
we will be leaving for our homes. Alright let
me tell you what is troubling me.” She
continued, “Chila, about 4-5 days before I
was very happy, when I learnt that I am
going to become a mother. Every night I
dreamt about the child and now my mother-
in-law is about to take me to the doctor for
a sex- determination test. My mother-in-law
says that the first child should be a boy. I
know that carrying out a sex-determination
test is an offence. Do you remember that
lady doctor who told us in school that
determining the sex of the foetus is an
offence? But how will I say this to my in-
laws? What shall I do? Tell me.”
6On hearing this, Chila held her head and
said, “My God! This thing was also running
through my head. This was what I was going
to say. Do you remember that everyone was
displeased when a daughter was born to
me? Everyone was chiding me and this time
everyone in my family is asking me to go
for a sex-determination test. I am really
scared. If this time also I give birth to a
daughter, then....? Are we going to commit
this offence? Madam Doctor said that this
is a crime. We will become criminals,
Khandang.”
Khandang showed a lot of conviction and
said out rightly, “No Chila, whatever may
be, we are not going to do anything wrong.
The lady doctor from the city comes on
Mondays only. Our family members will be
taking us to her on that day. Think of
something as to how can we be saved from
this sin.”
7Both of them silently thought about this
matter. Then Chila whispered into
Khandang’s ears, “Have courage. We are
two of us here.” Thereafter, both of them
left for their own respective homes.
On Monday, Chila’s mother -in-law took
her to the hospital. While Chila was sitting
on the bench and waiting for her turn, she
was also waiting for Khandang’s arrival. A
few moments later, Khandang arrived with
her mother-in-law. The lady doctor also
arrived at the hospital after sometime. Both
Chila and Khandang were surprised to learn
that the lady doctor is the same doctor who
used to visit their school. They held each
others’ hand and saw a ray of hope. Both of
their fears vanished and they both gave a
smile of relief.
During the check up, Khandang’s
mother-in-law was present with her. So, she
8was unable to say anything. However, when
Chila got the chance, she told the doctor
what was in her mind. The doctor consoled
her and gestured to her to remain quiet.
After a while, Chila’s mother-in-law slowly
requested the doctor to carry out the sex-
determination test. However, the doctor
flatly refused to do so. The doctor also called
in Khandang’s mother-in-law. Then she
started explaining to both of them, “It is God
9who decides whether the child will be a boy
or a girl. Pre-natal sex-determination is a
punishable offence. Determination of sex of
the foetus will result in punishment for you
as well as for me....”
In the meanwhile, when the doctor was
explaining to both the mothers-in-law inside
the chamber, the two close friends hugged
each other outside with tears of joy.
10Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal
Diagnostic Techniques (Prohibition of
Sex Selection) Act, 1994, amended
2003.
A few years back, the technology for pre-
natal sex determination was developed. This
technology is useful in detecting and curing
the physical and mental defects of the child
in the womb. Moreover, with this technology
other diseases of the foetus can be detected
and the diseases can be cured.
However, this technology has been
misutilised. People have been using this
technology to determine the sex/gender of
the foetus. When people came to know that
the foetus was that of a girl, they would go
for forced abortion. As a result, the number
of female foeticide cases began to rise. Due
to this, the ratio of females to males (sex
ratio) began to fall in a rapid pace. To curb
11with the dwindling sex ratio and
misutilisation of the technology, an Act was
enacted. The Act is known as The Pre-
Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic
Techniques (Prohibition of Sex Selection)
Act, 1994, as amended in 2003. As per the
provisions of this Act, any laboratory,
testing/examination centre or clinic is
restricted from determining the sex of the
foetus. According to this Act, determination
of the sex of the foetus is allowed only in
certain special conditions.
Pre-Natal Diagnostic Tests are
considered legal only in the following
conditions:
♦
The child in the womb has chromosomal
irregularity/abnormality.
♦
The pregnant woman has undergone two
or more spontaneous abortions.
12♦
The age of the pregnant woman is above
35 years.
♦
The pregnant woman had been exposed
to potentially teratogenic agents such as
drugs, radiation, infection or chemicals,
which may result in physical deformities
or mental retardation of the child.
♦
The pregnant woman or her spouse has
a family history of mental retardation or
physical deformities such as, spasticity
or any other genetic disease
Penalties as per the Act
♦
If any person goes for sex determination
test wilfully or under pressure, then he
or she will be deemed as guilty. The
penalties for the offence is imprisonment
for a term which may extend to 3 years
or with fine which may extend to
Rs. 10,000/- or both.
13♦
Any person engaged in determination of
the sex of the foetus or any person who
owns a test/examination centre and
contravenes any of the provisions of the
Act or rules thereunder shall be punishable
with imprisonment for a term not
extending 3 years or with fine which may
extend to Rs. 10,000/- or both.
♦
On subsequent conviction, the offender
will be punishable with imprisonment
extending to 5 years and with fine which
may extend to Rs. 50,000/-.
♦
After carrying out the test of determining
the sex of the foetus, if the medical
practitioner or the compounder reveals
the sex of the foetus, it is deemed as
criminal conduct and they too can be
booked under this Act.
♦
If the offence is made by a doctor/
medical practitioner, it may result in
14suspension of the registration and
removal of his name from the register of
the Council (State Medical Council) for a
period of 5 years for the first offence and
permanently for the subsequent offence.
♦
Advertisements on pre-natal sex
determination are also unlawful and illegal.
Any person or organisation involved in
such advertisement shall be punishable
with imprisonment for a term not
extending 3 years or with fine which may
extend to Rs. 10,000/-.
M.T.P. Act, 1971 (Medical Termination
of Pregnancy)
♦
Sex determination or medical
termination of pregnancy after
determination is an offence. However,
medical termination of pregnancy is legal
under certain circumstances.
15♦
These circumstances are in consonance
with MTP Act, 1971 (Medical Termination
of Pregnancy Act, 1971). Under this Act,
medical termination of pregnancy can be
carried out only within 12 weeks of
pregnancy. Only under the following
circumstances, medical termination of
pregnancy may be carried out if :
 the pregnancy is fatal for the mother.
 conception is due to rape.
 conception is due to failure of family
planning techniques or
 the unborn child has abnormalities/
deformities.
♦
Medical termination of pregnancy should
be within 12 weeks of pregnancy. Under
special circumstances, medical
termination of pregnancy can be carried
out up to 20 weeks of pregnancy on the
16advice of 2 doctors. Medical termination
of pregnancy is not possible after the fifth
month of pregnancy.
What We Can Do
♦
We should not indulge in pre-natal sex
determination in our families.
♦
We should also advise our relatives,
friends and neighbours to abstain from
pre-natal sex determination.
♦
If any women in the vicinity seem to be afraid
or under pressure to carry out pre-natal sex
determination, we should reach out to help
her.
♦
Doctors should pledge that they will
never indulge in the crime of female
foeticide.
♦
If we notice any such kind of activity in
our vicinity, then we should immediately
inform the Health Department.
17♦
We should have discussions in the
society to change our attitude towards
the girl child.
♦
At village level gatherings/assemblies,
we should take resolutions to save the
girl child.
♦
We should spread awareness among all
village folks to stop female foeticide.
♦
All young girls should be prepared with
the mindset that they will not indulge in
the crime of pre-natal sex determination
in their future lives.

****(Sepila’s School)
The construction activities of various high rise
structures and buildings were going on in full
swing in the city. The parents of Sepila work in
these sites and Sepila migrated to the city along
with them. As a result, she had to leave behind
her small village and her school. Sepila had just
begun her education in school. She was beginning
to read and understand small short stories. Along
with them, other families of the village and their
children also migrated to the city. As the parents
and other elders were engaged as workers in the
construction sites, the children’s group spent their
time in fun and frolic. For the first few days, the
children were extremely happy since they were
all living a carefree life.
After the passage of 10 – 15 days, Sepila
asked her mother, “Mom, when will you be granted
leave? When will I return to school?”
1Her mother replied, “When the entire building
will be completed, we will return to our village.
Then you can go to your school.”
Sepila went back to her friends and got
involved with their fun and games. The next day,
when all the children were playing, a lady
approached them. The lady asked all the children,
“Why don’t you all go to school?”
The children replied, “Our school is in the
village which is very far from here. We are only
staying here for a few days.”
2The lady smiled and asked, “Okay, will you
all not take me to your home?”
The children replied, “Why not? Of course we
all will take you to our homes.” The children then
escorted the lady to their homes. The lady talked
about all the children with their parents. She
explained to them that they should send their
children to the nearest school.
Sepila’s mother said, “Madam, Sepila was
actually asking the question as to when will she
return to school. However we are strangers to
3this place. How can we enrol our children in a
school in this place?”
The lady replied that she was currently a
teacher of the nearby school. She said, “Now, it
is the responsibility of the government to provide
education to all the children in the age group of 6
(six) to 14 (fourteen) years. To enforce this, the
‘Right to Education Act’ has been enacted. All of
you can enrol your children in the nearest school.
Sepila’s mother said, “We do not have any
documents with us.” To this, the lady replied,
4“You do not need any documents to enrol your
children in the school. For enrolling your children,
you neither need to pay any fees nor incur any
expenditure. Come to our school tomorrow
itself.”
Sepila was extremely delighted to hear all
these. She said, “Wow mom! My school came
here along with me!”.

****Question of Dignity
It has been only the sixth year of
Hechila’s marriage and she has been
widowed. The entire responsibility of
upbringing her two children have fallen on
her shoulders. She did not even get a chance
to mourn for the demise of her husband.
Previously it was the onus of attending to
her relatives and now it is the question of
upbringing her children. Dealing with all
these, the time has come when Hechila has
to take a decision that she should get
engaged in a job.
After all, where
will she be
getting the
money to pay for
the house rent,
education of her
children and food
and clothing?
1While these questions were running
through her mind, an idea dawned in her
mind. Hechila knows the work of appliqué
very well. She started thinking that during
this tough and trying time of hers, it will be
her skill that will be of great help. Hechila
expressed her thoughts to her neighbour,
Aunt Khumla. After hearing what Hechila has
been thinking, Khumla said that she will try
to arrange for some job for her (Hechila)
after consulting with her husband.
After a few days, Khumla asked Hechila
to display some of the samples of her work
to the nearby boutique. If they like and
accept her work, she may get a chance to
work on their orders. There was a ray of
hope for Hechila. She had with her wallets,
mobile cover, purse, etc. which were
previously made by her. She opened her old
trunk and started searching for those items.
While going through the items, she came
2across her wedding dress in the trunk which
made her cry a lot. Then she consoled herself
and looked at the positive side. After all,
her children, the token of her husband are
with her. She then took out the appliqué
samples from the trunk
and proceeded
towards the kitchen
for her chores.
H e c h i l a
q u i c k l y
completed
her daily
c h o r e s
early in the
morning.
Thereafter, she proceeded towards the
address given by Aunt Khumla. She was
filled with apprehensions and mixed
thoughts. She began thinking, “What will I
do if they don’t accept my works; I don’t
3know anything apart from it. If they refuse
these works of mine, I will start preparing
tiffins. However for preparing the tiffins,
where will I get additional money to
purchase foodgrains, vegetables and
pulses? Additionally, I will also have to buy
tiffin carriers.” When all these thoughts were
running thick and fast through her mind,
she reached the boutique. She stepped into
the boutique with a lot of fear, nervousness
and apprehension.
It is for the first time in her life that she
is seeing the interior of such a beautiful
boutique. She was awestruck at the
collection of the various mekhalas, ladies
tops and shawls. Looking at all these she
started thinking, “Will I ever be able to make
such items?” At that instant, she was
suddenly intercepted by the sight of a
woman coming towards her. She was
Sangtila, the owner of the boutique. Sangtila
asked Hechila, “How may I help you?”
4Hechila narrated her sad story and
sequence of events with tearful eyes to
Sangtila and displayed the samples to her.
The samples were really beautiful. Looking
at them Sangtila said, “Don’t think that I
am doing a favour for you. You have fineness
in your hands. Don’t worry, I will provide a
job for you.” Hearing this, Hechila quietly
5thanked God. She was in disbelief that her
prayers were answered so soon.
Sangtila handed over to Hechila a
mekhala, design samples, beads, threads
and many other such materials. She also
gave her a deadline when Hechila is
supposed to complete the work and bring it
to the boutique. Thereafter, everyday in the
afternoon,
H e c h i l a
started her
work of
appliqué. As
a result, the
o u t c o m e
was such
that, Hechila completed her work before the
given date. Hechila was eagerly waiting for
her first salary. On the said deadline, she
reached the boutique and showed her work
to Sangtila. Sangtila was quite happy at
6Hechila’s work and asked Chuba, an
employee of the boutique, to pay her the
requisite amount of money.
This time Hechila took along a shawl with
her. The bigger the work, the bigger is the
money. This went on for quite a while. In
the meanwhile, Hechila admitted her
daughter in a school. Slowly she started
saving some amount of money after
meeting all her expenses. Appliqué was a
hobby of Hechila. She was happy that her
skill has helped her in the time of her need.
There were many instances when
Hechila collected her salary from Chuba
when Sangtila was not around in the
boutique. There were a number of times
when Hechila felt that Chuba stared at her
in an inappropriate manner, but she ignored
his stares. Soon there were times when
Chuba handed over her salary in such a way
that his hands touched hers. Hechila felt
7uncomfortable at all these happenings but
abstained from saying anything. She
consoled herself by thinking that these are
mere accidents.
Chuba knew about the condition of
Hechila’s family. He knew that she was a
helpless lady. Now, Chuba started calling
Hechila in the boutique when Sangtila was
not around. There were many times when
he stood extremely close to her or tried to
obstruct her way by standing at the doorway
when Hechila moved out of the boutique.
Hechila had no other options since she had
to draw her salary through Chuba only.
Hechila started getting depressed. She
started despising the actions of Chuba. At
times, she cried and wept at home alone.
At one instance, when Hechila visited the
boutique with her works, only a few workers
were present. Taking advantage of the
situation, Chuba expressed his desire to
8Hechila to
have physical
relationship
with her.
Hechila was
shocked at
this indecent
proposal of
Chuba. She
ran home
without even taking her money. She was
shivering with the fear that some kind of
crime was about to take place. She turned
pale. It was for the first time that such kind
of statement was made to her.
While Hechila was on her way to her
home, she coincidently met her neighbour,
Aunt Khumla. Hechila turned emotional when
she saw Aunt Khumla. On being asked by
Aunt Khumla the reason of Hechila being
emotional, Hechila narrated the entire
9incident that she had faced. She had fear in
her mind as to what will happen in the near
future. The next time she goes to collect
her dues, what will Chuba say and do? Being
fed up of these, she wanted to leave the
job. Aunt Khumla told her not to be scared
about this matter. If she leaves this job what
other alternative does she have? What
guarantees her that there will be no people
like Chuba in other jobs? Aunt Khumla
further said that she came across an article
in the newspaper that such kind of
unwanted and unwarranted behaviours are
punishable offences as per the law, which
Chuba deserves. Both of them then decided
that they will narrate the incident to Sangtila
so that the other ladies in the boutique will
be spared from the same harassment from
Chuba.
Sangtila’s husband held a high
designation in the Department of Police and
10hence, she was aware of such laws. Chuba
got scared at the warning given by Sangtila.
He was deeply worried about his wife and
children as to
who will be
looking after
them if he will
be put
behind bars.
He started
begging for
forgiveness
to Sangtila and said,
“Henceforth, I will not commit such an
offence in the future”.
Sangtila wanted to give Chuba a second
chance, since this was the first time that he
was found guilty of such offence. However,
to make him realise the gravity of his
offence, she wanted him to meet her
husband the next day. Having no other
alternative, Chuba agreed to do so.
11The next day, Chuba was presented
before Sangtila’s husband. Her husband
attended to the matter very seriously. He
told Chuba that in today’s world, terrible and
dreadful crime
against women
starts from
such small
incidents. The
m a t t e r
worsens by
the day.
T o d a y
women have
come out of their homes and started
working. Men should try to understand their
conditions. Men have no right to make
friendship against their wishes. For a
woman, her dignity is of the highest
importance, which even men should try to
protect.
12Sangtila warned Chuba, “This is your first
offence, so I will give you a chance to correct
and improve yourself. Henceforth, your
behaviour towards Hechila should be a
respectable one or else you will be behind
the bars.” Chuba, with regretful tears in his
eyes, asked for forgiveness from Sangtila
and Hechila.
All this while, Hechila had been listening
to all these discussions. She was surprised
that the government had introduced so
many laws for preserving the dignity of a
woman and she was not aware of any of it.
Knowing all these, a new kind of strength
kindled within herself. She is now confident
that she, along with her children, can live a
life of honour and dignity in this unknown
world. Hechila bowed to God in reverence
once again and thanked the Almighty for
his never ending grace.

****STORY ON RIGHT TO INFORMATION
The village of Chungmoi is a small one;
with roughly 50 houses and one primary
school. The school, and their teacher,
Mr. Hopong’s house are made of tin while
all the other houses in the village are thatch
roofed.
The Public Work Department (PWD),
wanting to build a road through the edge of
their village, made provisions for acquiring
the required measurements for the
development of the road. Of what land they
use for the construction of the said road,
they promised all the necessary
compensation to the affected villagers.
On the 22nd of March, there was a public
announcement in the evening stating that
the compensation money would be
distributed the following morning and that
everyone who was to receive it was to report
1to the teacher, Mr. Hopong’s house to collect
their share.
The next day, as announced, all the land
owners assembled at Mr. Hopong’s house.
Two persons accompanied the P.W.D. head
and the Sub-Divisional Officer (SDO); the
people in charge of handing out the money
sat at a table and all who were to receive
the compensation money were seated facing
them.
2Standing up, the S.D.O said, “The land
we are taking from you is unequal and
varying in size. However, the difference is
not too vast, and since calculating each and
every person’s land is all too big a task in
itself, we have taken an average on the
compen-sation amount to be paid to each
of you. We will be giving everyone here a
sum of Rs. 20,000 for his land.” “Your names
and the amount you are to receive have
been written here and each of you will have
to give his signature next to his name. If
you are unable to write, your thumb print
will be sufficient,” he continued. The people
obliged and did as instructed, with every
person receiving his share of the money.
In Chungmoi, there was a person who
was strictly against corruption. His name
was, Mr. Awang. On learning about the
method of the distribution of the
compensation money, Mr. Awang had a
hunch about it. He asked Mrs. Apoung who
3was one of the land owners who received
the compensation about the matter. She
(Mrs. Apoung) is a person who is very
particular about things. Listening attentively
to what Mrs. Apoung said, Mr. Awang
adviced her to make an inquiry on the matter
under Right To Information (RTI).
Mrs. Apoung had never heard of the concept
before. He told her the meaning and the
workings of R.T.I. He explained to her that
R.T.I (Right to Information), is a device
which enabled
citizens to have
the necessary
information on
things done by
the government
to maintain
transparency and
curb corruption.
He continued by
telling her that
4whatever inquiry made, will be answered
within a period of 30 days failure to which,
the party under inquiry will be prosecuted.
Nothing is kept secret from the public unless
it is valuable information threatening
National security.
“Thank you. After hearing what you have
said, I have a feeling that something is not
right here. I will inform the others about it
5and we shall file an R.T.I inquiry with your
help”, said Mrs. Apoung.
Then the landowners of Chungmoi village
went to the District Headquarter P.W.D Office
and searched for the Public Information
Officer (P.I.O). On finding him, they handed
him the inquiry letter and the Rs. 10 fee.
They were informed that it would take 30
days for them to receive the information.
The appellate authority of the public
authority shall dispose of the appeal within
a period of thirty days or in exceptional
cases within 45 days of the receipt of the
appeal.
After investigation, it was found out that
the landowners got only half of the allotted
money for their land compensation, and the
money to be given each person also varied
according to the size of land used for the
construction site. Also, names of people who
did not belong to the village were found
6written on the list which stated that they
were paid the money.
The amount sanctioned by the
government was Rs. 5,00,000 but what the
people of Chungmoi received was only
Rs. 2,00,000 and that to the unknown
names was Rs. 1,00,000. The missing
Rs. 2,00,000 was not recorded. The
government launched an investigation
against the culprits of this misdemeanour.
7It was found that the P.W.D Minister
pocketed Rs. 2,00,000. Their modus
operandi was such that the minister called
his subordinate officer and told him this, “For
the Government work, Rs. 2,00,000 is
required. Quickly send that money. The
remaining Rs. 3,00,000, distributed as per
your discretion.”
Of the Rs. 5,00,000, the minister took
Rs. 2,00,000, the land owners of Chungmoi
received Rs. 2,00,000, and the remaining
Rs. 1,00,000 was written off to the names
of the people who were not residents of the
village of Chungmoi. The S.D.O, their cashier
and the Minister in charge where punished
as per the law. All the money that they
wrongfully took from the people, they were
forced to repay the full amount and by the
command of the court, all the people found
guilty were put behind bars.
8After this, all the land owners of
Chungmoi received the due amount which
they were each allotted and each of them
also upgraded from their thatch roof houses
to houses with roofs made of tin. The
widowed Mrs. Apoung received the largest
amount of money. With that money, she
constructed the biggest house in their
village.

****The Protection of Women from
Domestic Violence Act, 2005
Shongmu was preparing her daughter
Apoung for school. Apoung asked for money
to pay her school fees. Shongmu went to
her and asked him the required amount of
money to pay the school fees. This enraged
her husband. He started abusing and
screaming at Shongmu and said, “Does
money bloom in plants that I will pluck and
bring to you? What great will we achieve by
educating her so much? Teach her the daily
1household chores. They will be more useful
to her. I don’t have extra money to waste.
Go from here and start preparing my
breakfast.”
A couple of days later, Shongmu once
again asked her husband some money to
purchase some grocery items. To this, her
husband replied, “You ask for money all the
time. It seems you spend a lot of money. I
remember that only a few days back, you
took some money from me. Did you spend
all of it? Your parents have not gifted me a
big corpus of funds from which I can remit
you money daily. God! In whose company
have I fallen into?”
Shongmu always had to rely on her
husband for all her requirement, both small
and big. Her husband always insulted her
whenever she sought financial help. He
abused her and harassed her mentally. He
not only abused her but also her parents.
2One day, things went out of hand. Her
husband was drunk when he returned home
at night. Shongmu was setting the dinner
table. Her husband became angry at the
sight of the food and screamed at her, “What
kind of food is this? I give you so much
money to make purchases and yet you give
me such kind of food.”
3With the mixture of anger and
intoxication, he forcefully threw his dish from
the table. The dish hit Shongmu and all her
clothes were soiled with the food. To make
matters worse, the dish hit her face and
head. The impact was so great that she was
injured and her head started to bleed.
However, her husband was intoxicated; he
did not notice what had happened. Instead
he held her by her hair and started to
physically abuse and manhandled her. He
also threw her out of the house.
4Shongmu stood outside the house and
pleaded with her husband to let her in.
However, her husband did not let her in.
Instead he said, “Go away from here. From
today onwards you have no relation to this
house.” Shongmu’s neighbour, Khumla
noticed Shongmu in that condition and she
took her to her home. She attended to her
wounds and said, “How could you bear such
atrocities? Are you going to live your entire
life like this?”
5Shongmu replied, “Fate has this in store
for me. I carry out all the household activities
the whole day, but he treats me like his slave.
My only duties are to prepare food for the
family, washing clothes, sending the children
to school and tend to all his needs.”
Khumla said, “No, it is not like that.
Yesterday, I went to the Anganwadi meeting.
There one madam came. She said that a
law has been enacted for women. That law
is known as The Protection of Women from
Domestic Violence Act, 2005. We will seek
help under this law.”
The next morning, Khumla took
Shongmu to an official. The official is known
as Protection Officer in all the places.
Shongmu narrated all the past incidents and
experiences through which she went
through. The Protection Officer listened to
her very carefully. The Protection Officer who
was a lady said, “This law is made for
women like you who are victim to such
6atrocities. As per this law, your husband will
be called and we will make him understand.
If he does not conform to what we say, then
you can file a case against him. We will help
you in every possible ways.”
The lady Protection Officer handed over
a form to Shongmu which is known as D.I.R.
(Domestic Incident Report). This form
contains the description of the types of
7violence against women. The victimised
women should describe the type of violence
that has taken place against her. In case
the victimised woman is not educated, then
the Protection Officer himself/herself reads
the form to her so that she can describe the
type of violence that she has undergone
through.
By this process the D.I.R. Form of
Shongmu was filled and her husband was
called for reconciliation.
This law is designed to make homes
rather than breaking homes.

****Now No One Shall Remain Hungry
Uncle Showba said to Takam, “Takam,
is Lipokba in his right mind today?”
Takam replied, “Why? What happened
uncle?”
“He has been telling the whole village that
the government will now provide foodgrains
to all the poor at affordable prices.”
1“Oh, really! Has he been saying all these?
Then surely he has gone out of his mind.
Can this really happen?” asked Takam.
“Come on! Be happy that the
government is providing us food at
affordable rates. Where is the problem
there?” enquired Sangtila.
“Then let’s go and ask Prerak Awang of
Adult Education Centre” replied uncle.
After reaching the Adult Education
Centre, Takam greeted Awang, “Hello
2brother Awang”. Awang greeted and said,
“Hello. Why is it that all of you have come
together to meet me today?
“Brother Awang, we all have come here
to enquire about the scheme related to
foodgrains which the government has
announced.”
“Alright. Please take your seats and I
shall explain everything about it to all of you.
3The government has introduced Food
Security Scheme recently. This scheme has
been introduced with the aim of providing
nutritional and quality food to poor people
so that they can live a healthy life.”
Thereafter Takam asked, “What are the
provisions of this scheme?”
Awang replied, “Through this scheme,
people will receive rice, wheat and coarse
foodgrains at affordable and reasonable
rates.”
4Sangtila then questioned Awang, “Are
there any benefits for women in this
scheme?”
Awang nodded and answered, “Yes,
women will also be benefited through this
scheme. Pregnant and lactating women will
receive special nutritional support. Even
women who are the head of the family shall
receive special privilege. As per the scheme,
women will be considered to be the head of
the family and the ration card will be issued
in their names.”
“Alright, where can we obtain this card
from?” Takam asked.
At this, Awang replied, “This card can
be obtained from the Village Council or from
the office of the Food Department.”
“Where will the foodgrains be available?”
Uncle questioned.
5Awang said, “The foodgrains will be
available through Government Fair Price
Shops.”
“What will be the quantity of foodgrains
that we all will be receiving?” Menang
wondered.
Awang then replied to her question,
“Each family shall receive 35 kilograms of
foodgrains.”
After knowing about the scheme, uncle
was quite happy and contented and said,
“Thank you Awang, for providing us these
vital and valuable information. From now
on, no one in our village will be left hungry.”
Sangtila agreed with uncle’s statement
and happily remarked, “You are very right,
uncle Showba!”

****End of Atrocities
Likokba was a poor farmer. He belonged
to the Scheduled Caste community. He had
two acres of agricultural land beside the
street, near the river. Near Likokba’s land,
there was a land of Imlong, an affluent man
of the village, which was located towards
the back side of Likokba’s land.
Likokba was married to Menang. He was
blessed with a son named Awang and a
1daughter named Khumla. They all dwelled
in a small hut erected on his agricultural land.
Likokba’s daughter was about to get
married for which he was in need of money.
To seek financial help, he went to Imlong.
He asked Imlong to lend him some money
as a loan. Imlong agreed to provide the loan
to Likokba at once. However, Imlong’s
intentions were not right. He always wanted
to grab Likokba’s land by any means so that
his land will be connected with the street
that runs beside Likokba’s land.
Imlong considered this as a golden
opportunity for him. He said to Likokba,
“Likokba, I will provide you money, but you
have to carry out the formalities in the
government office.” Khumla’s marriage was
in the next month and Likokba was in dire
need of money. As Likokba was not
educated, he believed Imlong and agreed
to do what Imlong had said.
2Imlong lent the money to Likokba at the
government office. He prepared some
document and took Likokba’s thumb
impression on the documents.
Likokba’s daughter Khumla was married
to Hopong. During that year, there was a
good harvest of wheat in Likokba’s field. He
sold his wheat in the wholesale market for
farmer’s agricultural produce. The wheat
was sold at good rate. Since Likokba had
surplus money, he, along with his brother
Mandok, went to Imlong to pay off the loan
amount along with the interest.
3Likokba asked Imlong for the documents
wherein he had put his thumb impression
while taking the money. Imlong, deffered
the matter and gave the excuse that he will
have to search for the documents. He
assured Likokba that he will return him the
documents after finding them. As Likokba
and Mandok were innocent and illiterate
farmers, they believed Imlong and the
matter was left there itself.
Monsoon was soon approaching and
time has come to till the soil once again.
Likokba went to plough his field and sow
the seeds for the upcoming season.
When Likokba entered his field, he saw
the servants of Imlong were standing on
his field. When the servants saw Likokba,
they did not allow Likokba to plough his field
and chased him away from his land. Imlong’s
servants then started sowing the seeds with
the help of a tractor that belonged to
4Imlong. Likokba was perplexed and could
not understand what was going on. He then
approached Imlong to enquire about the
matter. Likokba asked Imlong, “You have
not returned me the documents where I put
my thumb impression on, even though I had
repaid the money that I borrowed from you.
Now what are your servants doing in my
land? Why are they sowing seeds in my land
with your tractor?”
Imlong replied in anger, “Likokba, you
have sold your land to me. You are no longer
5the owner of the land. If you ever set foot
on my land, I will kill you.”
Likokba got scared at the threat of
Imlong. He started crying and pleaded for
mercy. With folded hands, Likokba said,
“Soon after harvesting my crops and selling
them, I had returned the money that I owed
to you in front of Mandok as a witness.
However, you had not returned the
documents of the loan. Moreover, you have
even tried to deviate from the matter. For
God’s sake, please don’t be dishonest.”
On hearing this Imlong furiously said,
“Are you going to fight with me? Someone
throw him out of my house.”
Poor Likokba had no other option. He
wept and cried and came back to his home.
On his way, Likokba met the Village Council
Chairman. On seeing Likokba crying, he
enquired as to what the matter was.
6Likokba narrated the entire incident to the
Village Council Chairman with tearful eyes.
The Village Council Chairman listened to him
very carefully. He regained Likokba’s
composure and instilled courage in Likokba
and said, “You need not worry. Have courage.
The government has provided special
facilities and rights to the people belonging
to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
People belonging to Scheduled Castes or
Scheduled Tribes will receive justice, free of
cost, through special courts. You will get back
your land and Imlong will be put behind bars.”
7The Village Council Chairman took
Likokba to the police station where Likokba
narrated the entire story. The policeman,
after hearing from Likokba as to how his
land has been snatched, said, “Wrongfully
dispossessing a member of a Scheduled
Caste or Scheduled Tribe from his land by
any person will be considered as an offence.
Preparing fraud documents is a legal crime
which leads to severe penalty or
imprisonment. You lodge an FIR. Imlong will
be punished for his misdoings.”
The policeman further told Likokba, “The
trial of your case will be in a special court.
You don’t have to pay the legal charges and
the lawyer’s fees. The Government of India
has provided these facilities to the people
belonging to Scheduled Castes or Scheduled
Tribes so that they can live their life with
honour and dignity. As per this law, Imlong
will not be granted bail. You will receive your
farm land back. We will protect your land.”
8in his land and soon the seeds bloomed into
abundant greenery. Likokba and his family
were delighted to see the abundant crop in
their field. They started living a normal and
happy life. The police official who helped
Likokba often comes and inquires about his
daily state of affairs. He too was pleased
that Likokba is now leading a normal life.

****(Pongtang Gets Justice)
Pongtang was a labourer in Noksen
Village. His family comprised of his wife
Sepila, daughter Shongmu and son Mandok.
Pongtang’s aged father and mother also
lived with him. Pongtang and Sepila used to
work in farms to earn their family’s
livelihood.
A farmer named Hemyen lived in
Pongtang’s neighbourhood. He had five
acres of land in the village. He used to call
Pongtang and Sepila for tending the crops.
However, Pongtang and Sepila never went
to work in Hemyen’s farm because Hemyen
always looked at Sepila in an obscene and
lewd manner, which made Sepila
uncomfortable. Once, Pongtang and Sepila
went to Hemyen’s farm to sow some seeds.
While working, Hemyen sent Pongtang to
fetch the plough from Hemyen’s house. At
1that moment Hemyen started teasing and
taunting Sepila.
From that
i n c i d e n t
o n w a r d s ,
Pongtang and
Sepila stopped
going to
Hemyen’s farm
for any kind of
work. Due to this
reason, Hemyen
wanted to seek
vengeance on
them.
One day, a rich man’s jewels were stolen
in the village. The rich man lodged an FIR in
the Police Station regarding the theft, after
which the police started investigating the
matter in the village.
2Hemyen wanted to take advantage of
this situation. He planned to falsely accuse
Pongtang of this theft so that when Pongtang
is put behind bars, Sepila will approach him
to seek help since the Sub-Divisional lawyer,
Chaushak often visits Hemyen.
During the course of their investigation
when the police approached Hemyen,
Hemyen said, “It is Pongtang who has stolen
the jewels.”
The police went to Pongtang’s House and
found some of the stolen jewels in front of
his house. The police confiscated the jewels
and prepared a confiscation report. The
police became suspicious of Pongtang. They
searched the entire house of Pongtang but
did not find anything. However, they
arrested Pongtang. Following the arrest,
Sepila and his aged parents became scared
and anxious. Sepila said, “Who will save my
husband from being imprisoned? We neither
3have money to spend nor to pay the fees of
any lawyer.”
Hearing the words of Sepila, her son
Imlong said, “Mother, you need not worry.
I have seen a board near the bus stand
regarding free legal assistance and
consultancy. There, two lawyers were
talking to the Village Council Chairman. They
were saying that the government has made
provisions to provide justice to the poor
4villagers. Let us go to that office and try to
free our father.”
Hearing this, Sepila’s fear receded a bit.
She went to the Free Legal Assistance and
Consultancy Centre and met the lawyer.
The next day, the police presented
Pongtang in the court before the judge.
The judge started interrogating
Pongtang. Pongtang pleaded that he is
innocent and that
the theft was not
carried out by
him. He further
said that he is
falsely accused of
the theft and the
police forcefully
arrested him. He
and his family
earn their
livelihood by hard
work and not by
5wrong means. He said that he has not stolen
anything and the stolen items are not in his
possession.
The judge asked Pongtang, “Do you have
a lawyer to fight for your case and provide
you justice?”
Pongtang replied, “We are poor and
illiterate. How can we fight a case? We don’t
have any money to pay for a lawyer. When
will you set me free from the prison? I have
to go for my daily work to run my family.
The judge carefully listened to his words
and then he said, “We will provide you a
lawyer at the expense of the government.”
The lawyer from the Free Legal
Assistance and Consultancy Centre
appeared before the judge. His wife Sepila
and his son Mandok were also present with
the lawyer.
6The lawyer immediately presented the
papers for Pongtang’s bail. He told all the
truth about the case to the judge and asked
the judge to release him on bail.
The judge approved the bail plea of
Pongtang.
7Since the police filed a case against
Pongtang, the lawyer from the Free Legal
Assistance and Consultancy Centre fought for
Pongtang. He finally argued that Pongtang is
innocent. The stolen items were not recovered
from him and the police also failed to present
any witness or proof against Pongtang.
Considering all the facts, proofs and
witnesses of the case and the arguments of
the lawyers, the judge passed the
judgement that there is no proof against
Pongtang and he should be set free.
Free Legal Assistance and
Consultancy
Every citizen has the right to get justice.
Poor and illiterate people cannot afford to
pay lawyer’s fee as well as other legal
expenses. Hence, the government has
introduced a law to provide free legal
assistance and consultancy to the poor
people so that they can get proper justice.

the Scheme

and Scheduled Tribe.

****(Our Jungle – Our Trust)
The Scheduled Tribes and Other
Traditional Forest Dwellers
(Recognition of Forest Rights) Act,
2006 and Rules 2008
Today a lot of people have been moving
around in the village of Sanglao. Everyone
is going towards the Village Council. People
are expecting Chila, a female lawyer from
1the city. The Chairman of the Village Council
is a gentleman by the name of Showba. He
has been telling the people that the lawyer
will be discussing about the Law of Forest
Rights. This law has been enacted to protect
the rights of the tribal people who dwell in
forests. This law also covers the rights of
other traditional forest dwellers.
While Showba, the Chairman of the
Village Council, has been talking about all
these to the villagers, the lawyer, Chila
arrived at the gathering of the village council.
Everybody welcomed her with respect.
Thereafter, Chila began her talk. She said,
“All of you who have gathered here are
Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional
Dwellers who have been dwelling in forests
for centuries together. You all have always
trusted and contibuted greatly towards the
protection of the forests. The forest is your
home and if your home does not get the
2appropriate rights, it will be a big injustice
done to you all.”
She continued, “Among you all were
those tribes who had been compelled to
forego their homes in the name of
development and had to settle in some other
place. Insecurity related to land has been a
problem which has been continuing for a
long time. To curb this menace, Forest
Rights Act, 2006 and Rules 2008 have been
framed.” All the forest dwellers present at
3the gathering were listening very carefully
to Chila.
Hopong said: “Madam Lawyer, what
benefit will we get from this law?”
Chila replied: “This is a valid question.
In this Forest Rights Act, the Scheduled
Tribes and other forest dwellers have been
given some legal rights:
 All tribal dwellers who have been residing
in the forest earlier than 2005, shall
receive land rights documents.
4 All other traditional forest dwellers who
have been residing in the forest for three
generations (seventy five years) will also
receive land rights documents.
 Right of ownership shall also be given
for village, habitat and community forest
land.”
Imlong asked – “Are lands under
community rights also included under this
Law?”
Chila replies – “Yes, rights of land under
community rights will be given to forests
dwellers as per rules of the State.
 Forest rights will also be given to forest
dwelling Schedules Tribes and other
traditional forest dwellers on other
community rights of uses or entitlements
such as fish and other products of water
bodies.
 The forest dwelling Schedules Tribes and
other traditional forest dwellers shall have
5the right of access to collect, use and
dispose of minor forest produce such as
bamboo, brush wood, stumps, cane,
cocoons, honey, wax, lac, or leaves,
medicinal plants and herbs, roots, tubers,
stones, chips and the like.
 Forest dwelling Scheduled Tribes and
other traditional forest dwellers shall have
the rights to transport the minor forest
produce from the forest to villages and
market through head loading, bicycle or
hand cart.
 No licences shall be issued on water
bodies without the permission of the
community.”
Menang asked – “Can forest land be
utilised for any other purpose?”
Chila replied – “The Village Council has
the right for diversion of forest land for the
facilities like schools; dispensaries or
hospital; anganwadis; fair price shops;
6tanks and other minor water bodies; electric
lines, drinking water supply and water
pipelines; roads; skill upgradation or
vocational training centres; community
centres. However, this should involve felling
of trees not exceeding 75 trees.”
Figure 1
7Lithrongla was listening quietly up till
now. She also asked a question, “Who will
have the right over the habitat of the tribal
forest dwellers?”
Chila replied – “The tribal forest dwellers
will get the right of ownership over their
habitat. They will have the rights of
settlement and conversion of all forest
villagers, old habitation, villages which are
8not surveyed and other villages in forests
whether recorded, notified or not into
revenue villages.”
In today’s meeting, there are a lot of tribal
people who were forcefully removed from
their lands. Among them was Takam. He
gathered courage and asked, ‘Can the tribal
people who were displaced by the Forest
Department come back and resettle in their
own habitat?”
Chila could understand the pain of
Takam. She said, “If the tribal people are
displaced before 13th December, 2005 by
the Forest Department and if they have not
been given compensation and they have not
found a place to dwell, then they can resettle
in their previous dwelling place.
If the State plans to undertake certain
developmental projects and as a
consequence they need to acquire forest
lands, the developmental project should kick
9start in the acquired forest land within five
years of acquirement. At the time of
acquiring the forest land, if the State had
not paid any compensation to the displaced
forest dwellers and tribal people; and had
not made adequate arrangement for their
rehabilitation; and the development project
have not started within 5 years of
acquirement of the forest land, then the
10displaced people will get the right to resettle
in their original habitat.
Any Scheduled Tribe and other
traditional forest dweller cannot be
displaced from their original habitat until
and unless the viability and validity of the
project is established and complete
investigation of the same is carried out.”
Imlong asked – “Madam Lawyer, along
with our rights, what will be our duties?”
Chila answered –”In the Act, the duties
of the Scheduled Tribe and traditional forest
dwellers are also included along with their
rights. The prime duties include the
following:
 Protect the wildlife, forest and
biodiversity.
 Ensure that adjoining catchment area,
water sources and other ecologically
sensitive areas are adequately
protected.
11 Ensure that the decisions taken in the
Village Council will regulate access to
community forest resources and stop
any activity which adversely affects the
wild animals, forest and the biodiversity
are complied with.”
Hopong questioned – “At the Village
Council level, a Forest Rights Committee
will be constituted in the first meeting of
the Village Council. At this meeting, two-
third of the members of the Village Council
should be present.”
Khumla enquired – “The Forest Rights
Committee will consist of how many
members?”
Chila said – “The committee will be
constituted by 10-15 members of the
Village Council, out of whom at least 5
members should be tribal people and 5
members should be women. The
Committee should have a Chairman/
12President and a Secretary. There is a
provision to include the Village Council
Secretary or any member of the Village
Council in the post of Secretary in the Village
Rights Committee. It is not necessary to
include the Chairman of the Village Council,
members of the Village Council or any
government official in the Forest Rights
Committee.”
Hopong asked – “What do we have to
do to obtain the forest rights?”
Chila answered – “To obtain village
rights, the tribal people and forest dwellers
should fill up the Claim Form of the Forest
Rights Committee.”
Hemyen asked – “How will the villagers
claim the rights on their forest lands?”
Chila replied – “The Village Council gives
the right to the Forest Rights Committee
to receive claims. Thereafter the villagers
can submit their claims on the prescribed
13Claim Form to the Forest Rights Committee
in the Village Council Office. Along with the
application, the villagers should also submit
proof of their occupancy on the said piece
of land.”
He continued, “One of the copies of the
claim is kept with the committee and a seal
of receipt is stamped on the other copy. The
14villagers should keep the sealed copy with
them properly and safely.”
Hechila – “How is the resolution/
judgement passed on the occupancy
claimed by the claimants?
Chila answered – “The Village Council will
determine the eligibility of the claims raised
by the claimants and forward it to the Sub-
Divisional Level Committee. Thereafter, the
Sub-Divisional Level Committee will prepare
a report on the claims forwarded by the
Village Council and forward the same to the
District Committee for the final resolution/
judgement.”
Chuba – “Who gives the final judgement
on the claims?”
Chila replied – “Committees at the district
level gives the final judgement on all types
of individual and public claims. Each family
will have land rights on the occupied area
within ten acres. The land rights will be
15jointly in the name of the husband and the
wife or in the name of the survivor. Land
rights can neither be sold to anyone nor it
can be transferred to any other person’s
name but it can be transferred to their
children’s name.”
Hopong – “What is the role of Village
Council in the Forest Rights law?”
Chila – “The role of Village Council is to
give judgement on hearings of the nature
of forest rights and give demarcation of
boundaries.”
Pongtang asked – “What are the proofs
required for verification of claims?”
Chila – “Any claims filed will be on the
basis of two proofs out of the various
documents. The evidences which can be
presented are – Gazetteers, population
census, map, forest records, patta or lease,
any government order, notification,
government records, voter’s identity card,
16ration card, judgement of court, records
from erstwhile princely States or provinces
and genealogy tracing ancestry to
individuals mentioned in earlier land records.
The Village Council will record all information
in their register as per their rules. The Village
Council will give the claimants an opportunity
for hearing on the issues related to Forest
Rights. Thereafter, the Village Council will
pass a resolution/judgement and will
17forward the same to the Sub-Divisional Level
Committee.”
Chila then questioned – “What will a
person do if he/she is not satisfied with the
decision given/judgement passed by the
Village Council?”
Chila answered – “If any forest dwellers
is not satisfied with the decision given/
judgement passed by the Village Council,
he/she can file a petition to the Sub-
Divisional Committee within 60 days of the
resolution passed. If he/she is again not
satisfied with the decision /judgement of the
Sub-Divisional Committee, then he/she can
file a petition to the District Level Committee.
The decision given/judgement passed by
the District Level Committee will be final and
all shall abide by it.”
In this way, Chila informed about the
Forest Rights to all the forest dwellers. After
the gathering, the Chairman of the Village
18Council thanked Chila for providing them
valuable and vital information related to
Forest Rights. Then all the people dwelling
in the forest also thanked and praised her.
Chila brought a new faith among the
people of Sanglao. Everyone was happy to
know about their rights in their forest. It
was a heartening sight to see that the eyes
of everyone present at the gathering were
gleaming with joy as they are now assured
that their rights will be protected henceforth.
