has vetted the Legal Literacy Materials consisting of 11 booklets\\r\\nand 11 folders in English Language. These material are found to be\\r\\nsatisfactory and would be of immense use in disseminating legal awareness\\r\\nto the grassroots level in the State.\\r\\nDate: 28.02.2017 ( S.K. Sangma )\\r\\nUnder Secretary to the Govt. of Meghalaya,\\r\\nLaw Department.\\r\\n****Sex Determination is an Offence\\r\\nChila and Khandang were the best of\\r\\nfriends. Both of them studied together and\\r\\ngrew up together. One day Chila was\\r\\nengaged to get married. On hearing this\\r\\nnews, Khandang had mixed feelings. She\\r\\nwas happy as well as sad. She was happy\\r\\nbecause her friend is going to be settled and\\r\\nsad because both of them have to part from\\r\\neach other owing to their upcoming new\\r\\nlives.\\r\\n1Within a few days Chila got married.\\r\\nWhenever Chila visited her maternal home,\\r\\nboth Chila and Khandang used to talk for\\r\\nhours. Within their talks, Chila described her\\r\\nnew family to Khandang while Khandang\\r\\ndescribed the recent happenings in the\\r\\nvillage, the crops in the field and the\\r\\nthreshing place.\\r\\nA year later, Chila came to her maternal\\r\\nhome for maternal care. This time she was\\r\\ngoing to stay for a longer duration.\\r\\nKhandang was delighted at this. She often\\r\\ncame to visit Chila.\\r\\nChila was soon blessed with a beautiful\\r\\ndaughter. However, her in-laws seemed a\\r\\nbit unhappy. On the other side, Khandang\\r\\nwas extremely happy. To celebrate her\\r\\nhappiness, Khandang prepared some\\r\\n2laddoos (sweets) and took them to the\\r\\nhospital and distributed them to everyone.\\r\\nLooking at this, Khandang’s mother told\\r\\nChila, “Chila, without you Khandang\\r\\nbecomes very depressed but whenever you\\r\\nare by her side she gleams with happiness.\\r\\nWhy don’t you look for a suitable groom for\\r\\nher and take her to your village? Thereafter,\\r\\nboth of you can always be together.”\\r\\n3Fate took such a turn that Khandang too\\r\\ngot married to a person from the same\\r\\nvillage as that of Chila. Both of them were\\r\\nextremely happy. However, happiness was\\r\\nnot there for long. There were a lot of\\r\\nrestrictions in the house of the in-laws of\\r\\nKhandang. She was not allowed to meet\\r\\nanyone or go out of the house. Khandang\\r\\noften wondered as to when she will be able\\r\\nto meet Chila.\\r\\n4One day both Chila and Khandang met\\r\\neach other in the Church. There, both of\\r\\nthem decided that they will meet each other\\r\\nin the Church every Sunday evening. Both\\r\\nof them, then, eagerly waited for Sunday\\r\\nand when they met at the Church, they\\r\\ntalked on a variety of topics.\\r\\nOne Sunday evening, when both of them\\r\\nmet in the Church, both of them looked sad.\\r\\nUnlike the other days, both of them did not\\r\\nlook happy. Both of them sat at the steps of\\r\\nthe Church and Chila told Khandang,\\r\\n“Khandang, I have something to tell you.”\\r\\n“Something is also troubling me too,\\r\\nChila” said Khandang.\\r\\n“Troubling you? What is troubling you?”\\r\\nasked Chila.\\r\\nKhandang said, “First you. Let me know\\r\\nwhat you want to tell.”\\r\\n5Chila replied, “No, first you. I would like\\r\\nto solve your problem first. Tell me what is\\r\\ntroubling you?”\\r\\nKhandang then replied, “This ‘you first’,\\r\\n‘you first’ will finally lead us to the time when\\r\\nwe will be leaving for our homes. Alright let\\r\\nme tell you what is troubling me.” She\\r\\ncontinued, “Chila, about 4-5 days before I\\r\\nwas very happy, when I learnt that I am\\r\\ngoing to become a mother. Every night I\\r\\ndreamt about the child and now my mother-\\r\\nin-law is about to take me to the doctor for\\r\\na sex- determination test. My mother-in-law\\r\\nsays that the first child should be a boy. I\\r\\nknow that carrying out a sex-determination\\r\\ntest is an offence. Do you remember that\\r\\nlady doctor who told us in school that\\r\\ndetermining the sex of the foetus is an\\r\\noffence? But how will I say this to my in-\\r\\nlaws? What shall I do? Tell me.”\\r\\n6On hearing this, Chila held her head and\\r\\nsaid, “My God! This thing was also running\\r\\nthrough my head. This was what I was going\\r\\nto say. Do you remember that everyone was\\r\\ndispleased when a daughter was born to\\r\\nme? Everyone was chiding me and this time\\r\\neveryone in my family is asking me to go\\r\\nfor a sex-determination test. I am really\\r\\nscared. If this time also I give birth to a\\r\\ndaughter, then....? Are we going to commit\\r\\nthis offence? Madam Doctor said that this\\r\\nis a crime. We will become criminals,\\r\\nKhandang.”\\r\\nKhandang showed a lot of conviction and\\r\\nsaid out rightly, “No Chila, whatever may\\r\\nbe, we are not going to do anything wrong.\\r\\nThe lady doctor from the city comes on\\r\\nMondays only. Our family members will be\\r\\ntaking us to her on that day. Think of\\r\\nsomething as to how can we be saved from\\r\\nthis sin.”\\r\\n7Both of them silently thought about this\\r\\nmatter. Then Chila whispered into\\r\\nKhandang’s ears, “Have courage. We are\\r\\ntwo of us here.” Thereafter, both of them\\r\\nleft for their own respective homes.\\r\\nOn Monday, Chila’s mother -in-law took\\r\\nher to the hospital. While Chila was sitting\\r\\non the bench and waiting for her turn, she\\r\\nwas also waiting for Khandang’s arrival. A\\r\\nfew moments later, Khandang arrived with\\r\\nher mother-in-law. The lady doctor also\\r\\narrived at the hospital after sometime. Both\\r\\nChila and Khandang were surprised to learn\\r\\nthat the lady doctor is the same doctor who\\r\\nused to visit their school. They held each\\r\\nothers’ hand and saw a ray of hope. Both of\\r\\ntheir fears vanished and they both gave a\\r\\nsmile of relief.\\r\\nDuring the check up, Khandang’s\\r\\nmother-in-law was present with her. So, she\\r\\n8was unable to say anything. However, when\\r\\nChila got the chance, she told the doctor\\r\\nwhat was in her mind. The doctor consoled\\r\\nher and gestured to her to remain quiet.\\r\\nAfter a while, Chila’s mother-in-law slowly\\r\\nrequested the doctor to carry out the sex-\\r\\ndetermination test. However, the doctor\\r\\nflatly refused to do so. The doctor also called\\r\\nin Khandang’s mother-in-law. Then she\\r\\nstarted explaining to both of them, “It is God\\r\\n9who decides whether the child will be a boy\\r\\nor a girl. Pre-natal sex-determination is a\\r\\npunishable offence. Determination of sex of\\r\\nthe foetus will result in punishment for you\\r\\nas well as for me....”\\r\\nIn the meanwhile, when the doctor was\\r\\nexplaining to both the mothers-in-law inside\\r\\nthe chamber, the two close friends hugged\\r\\neach other outside with tears of joy.\\r\\n10Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal\\r\\nDiagnostic Techniques (Prohibition of\\r\\nSex Selection) Act, 1994, amended\\r\\n2003.\\r\\nA few years back, the technology for pre-\\r\\nnatal sex determination was developed. This\\r\\ntechnology is useful in detecting and curing\\r\\nthe physical and mental defects of the child\\r\\nin the womb. Moreover, with this technology\\r\\nother diseases of the foetus can be detected\\r\\nand the diseases can be cured.\\r\\nHowever, this technology has been\\r\\nmisutilised. People have been using this\\r\\ntechnology to determine the sex/gender of\\r\\nthe foetus. When people came to know that\\r\\nthe foetus was that of a girl, they would go\\r\\nfor forced abortion. As a result, the number\\r\\nof female foeticide cases began to rise. Due\\r\\nto this, the ratio of females to males (sex\\r\\nratio) began to fall in a rapid pace. To curb\\r\\n11with the dwindling sex ratio and\\r\\nmisutilisation of the technology, an Act was\\r\\nenacted. The Act is known as The Pre-\\r\\nConception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic\\r\\nTechniques (Prohibition of Sex Selection)\\r\\nAct, 1994, as amended in 2003. As per the\\r\\nprovisions of this Act, any laboratory,\\r\\ntesting/examination centre or clinic is\\r\\nrestricted from determining the sex of the\\r\\nfoetus. According to this Act, determination\\r\\nof the sex of the foetus is allowed only in\\r\\ncertain special conditions.\\r\\nPre-Natal Diagnostic Tests are\\r\\nconsidered legal only in the following\\r\\nconditions:\\r\\n♦\\r\\nThe child in the womb has chromosomal\\r\\nirregularity/abnormality.\\r\\n♦\\r\\nThe pregnant woman has undergone two\\r\\nor more spontaneous abortions.\\r\\n12♦\\r\\nThe age of the pregnant woman is above\\r\\n35 years.\\r\\n♦\\r\\nThe pregnant woman had been exposed\\r\\nto potentially teratogenic agents such as\\r\\ndrugs, radiation, infection or chemicals,\\r\\nwhich may result in physical deformities\\r\\nor mental retardation of the child.\\r\\n♦\\r\\nThe pregnant woman or her spouse has\\r\\na family history of mental retardation or\\r\\nphysical deformities such as, spasticity\\r\\nor any other genetic disease\\r\\nPenalties as per the Act\\r\\n♦\\r\\nIf any person goes for sex determination\\r\\ntest wilfully or under pressure, then he\\r\\nor she will be deemed as guilty. The\\r\\npenalties for the offence is imprisonment\\r\\nfor a term which may extend to 3 years\\r\\nor with fine which may extend to\\r\\nRs. 10,000/- or both.\\r\\n13♦\\r\\nAny person engaged in determination of\\r\\nthe sex of the foetus or any person who\\r\\nowns a test/examination centre and\\r\\ncontravenes any of the provisions of the\\r\\nAct or rules thereunder shall be punishable\\r\\nwith imprisonment for a term not\\r\\nextending 3 years or with fine which may\\r\\nextend to Rs. 10,000/- or both.\\r\\n♦\\r\\nOn subsequent conviction, the offender\\r\\nwill be punishable with imprisonment\\r\\nextending to 5 years and with fine which\\r\\nmay extend to Rs. 50,000/-.\\r\\n♦\\r\\nAfter carrying out the test of determining\\r\\nthe sex of the foetus, if the medical\\r\\npractitioner or the compounder reveals\\r\\nthe sex of the foetus, it is deemed as\\r\\ncriminal conduct and they too can be\\r\\nbooked under this Act.\\r\\n♦\\r\\nIf the offence is made by a doctor/\\r\\nmedical practitioner, it may result in\\r\\n14suspension of the registration and\\r\\nremoval of his name from the register of\\r\\nthe Council (State Medical Council) for a\\r\\nperiod of 5 years for the first offence and\\r\\npermanently for the subsequent offence.\\r\\n♦\\r\\nAdvertisements on pre-natal sex\\r\\ndetermination are also unlawful and illegal.\\r\\nAny person or organisation involved in\\r\\nsuch advertisement shall be punishable\\r\\nwith imprisonment for a term not\\r\\nextending 3 years or with fine which may\\r\\nextend to Rs. 10,000/-.\\r\\nM.T.P. Act, 1971 (Medical Termination\\r\\nof Pregnancy)\\r\\n♦\\r\\nSex determination or medical\\r\\ntermination of pregnancy after\\r\\ndetermination is an offence.

The parents of Sepila work in\\r\\nthese sites and Sepila migrated to the city along\\r\\nwith them. As a result, she had to leave behind\\r\\nher small village and her school. Sepila had just\\r\\nbegun her education in school. She was beginning\\r\\nto read and understand small short stories. Along\\r\\nwith them, other families of the village and their\\r\\nchildren also migrated to the city. As the parents\\r\\nand other elders were engaged as workers in the\\r\\nconstruction sites, the children’s group spent their\\r\\ntime in fun and frolic. For the first few days, the\\r\\nchildren were extremely happy since they were\\r\\nall living a carefree life.\\r\\nAfter the passage of 10 – 15 days, Sepila\\r\\nasked her mother, “Mom, when will you be granted\\r\\nleave? When will I return to school?”\\r\\n1Her mother replied, “When the entire building\\r\\nwill be completed, we will return to our village.\\r\\nThen you can go to your school.”\\r\\nSepila went back to her friends and got\\r\\ninvolved with their fun and games. The next day,\\r\\nwhen all the children were playing, a lady\\r\\napproached them. The lady asked all the children,\\r\\n“Why don’t you all go to school?”\\r\\nThe children replied, “Our school is in the\\r\\nvillage which is very far from here. We are only\\r\\nstaying here for a few days.”\\r\\n2The lady smiled and asked, “Okay, will you\\r\\nall not take me to your home?”\\r\\nThe children replied, “Why not? Of course we\\r\\nall will take you to our homes.” The children then\\r\\nescorted the lady to their homes. The lady talked\\r\\nabout all the children with their parents. She\\r\\nexplained to them that they should send their\\r\\nchildren to the nearest school.\\r\\nSepila’s mother said, “Madam, Sepila was\\r\\nactually asking the question as to when will she\\r\\nreturn to school. However we are strangers to\\r\\n3this place. How can we enrol our children in a\\r\\nschool in this place?”\\r\\nThe lady replied that she was currently a\\r\\nteacher of the nearby school. She said, “Now, it\\r\\nis the responsibility of the government to provide\\r\\neducation to all the children in the age group of 6\\r\\n(six) to 14 (fourteen) years. To enforce this, the\\r\\n‘Right to Education Act’ has been enacted. All of\\r\\nyou can enrol your children in the nearest school.\\r\\nSepila’s mother said, “We do not have any\\r\\ndocuments with us.” To this, the lady replied,\\r\\n4“You do not need any documents to enrol your\\r\\nchildren in the school. For enrolling your children,\\r\\nyou neither need to pay any fees nor incur any\\r\\nexpenditure. Come to our school tomorrow\\r\\nitself.”\\r\\nSepila was extremely delighted to hear all\\r\\nthese. She said, “Wow mom! My school came\\r\\nhere along with me!”.\\r\\n5The Right of Children to Free and\\r\\nCompulsory Education Act, 2009\\r\\nThe Government of India has enacted the\\r\\n“Right of Children to Free and Compulsory\\r\\nEducation Act” in the year 2009.

2017.\\r\\nC E R T I F I C A T E\\r\\nThis is to certify that the Law Department, Govenment of\\r\\nMeghalaya has vetted the Legal Literacy Materials consisting of 11 booklets\\r\\nand 11 folders in English Language. These material are found to be\\r\\nsatisfactory and would be of immense use in disseminating legal awareness\\r\\nto the grassroots level in the State.\\r\\nDate: 28.02.2017 ( S.K. Sangma )\\r\\nUnder Secretary to the Govt. of Meghalaya,\\r\\nLaw Department.\\r\\n****Question of Dignity\\r\\nIt has been only the sixth year of\\r\\nHechila’s marriage and she has been\\r\\nwidowed. The entire responsibility of\\r\\nupbringing her two children have fallen on\\r\\nher shoulders. She did not even get a chance\\r\\nto mourn for the demise of her husband.\\r\\nPreviously it was the onus of attending to\\r\\nher relatives and now it is the question of\\r\\nupbringing her children. Dealing with all\\r\\nthese, the time has come when Hechila has\\r\\nto take a decision that she should get\\r\\nengaged in a job.\\r\\nAfter all, where\\r\\nwill she be\\r\\ngetting the\\r\\nmoney to pay for\\r\\nthe house rent,\\r\\neducation of her\\r\\nchildren and food\\r\\nand clothing?\\r\\n1While these questions were running\\r\\nthrough her mind, an idea dawned in her\\r\\nmind. Hechila knows the work of appliqué\\r\\nvery well. She started thinking that during\\r\\nthis tough and trying time of hers, it will be\\r\\nher skill that will be of great help. Hechila\\r\\nexpressed her thoughts to her neighbour,\\r\\nAunt Khumla. After hearing what Hechila has\\r\\nbeen thinking, Khumla said that she will try\\r\\nto arrange for some job for her (Hechila)\\r\\nafter consulting with her husband.\\r\\nAfter a few days, Khumla asked Hechila\\r\\nto display some of the samples of her work\\r\\nto the nearby boutique. If they like and\\r\\naccept her work, she may get a chance to\\r\\nwork on their orders. There was a ray of\\r\\nhope for Hechila. She had with her wallets,\\r\\nmobile cover, purse, etc. which were\\r\\npreviously made by her. She opened her old\\r\\ntrunk and started searching for those items.\\r\\nWhile going through the items, she came\\r\\n2across her wedding dress in the trunk which\\r\\nmade her cry a lot. Then she consoled herself\\r\\nand looked at the positive side. After all,\\r\\nher children, the token of her husband are\\r\\nwith her. She then took out the appliqué\\r\\nsamples from the trunk\\r\\nand proceeded\\r\\ntowards the kitchen\\r\\nfor her chores.\\r\\nH e c h i l a\\r\\nq u i c k l y\\r\\ncompleted\\r\\nher daily\\r\\nc h o r e s\\r\\nearly in the\\r\\nmorning.\\r\\nThereafter, she proceeded towards the\\r\\naddress given by Aunt Khumla. She was\\r\\nfilled with apprehensions and mixed\\r\\nthoughts. She began thinking, “What will I\\r\\ndo if they don’t accept my works; I don’t\\r\\n3know anything apart from it. If they refuse\\r\\nthese works of mine, I will start preparing\\r\\ntiffins. However for preparing the tiffins,\\r\\nwhere will I get additional money to\\r\\npurchase foodgrains, vegetables and\\r\\npulses? Additionally, I will also have to buy\\r\\ntiffin carriers.” When all these thoughts were\\r\\nrunning thick and fast through her mind,\\r\\nshe reached the boutique. She stepped into\\r\\nthe boutique with a lot of fear, nervousness\\r\\nand apprehension.\\r\\nIt is for the first time in her life that she\\r\\nis seeing the interior of such a beautiful\\r\\nboutique. She was awestruck at the\\r\\ncollection of the various mekhalas, ladies\\r\\ntops and shawls. Looking at all these she\\r\\nstarted thinking, “Will I ever be able to make\\r\\nsuch items?” At that instant, she was\\r\\nsuddenly intercepted by the sight of a\\r\\nwoman coming towards her. She was\\r\\nSangtila, the owner of the boutique. Sangtila\\r\\nasked Hechila, “How may I help you?”\\r\\n4Hechila narrated her sad story and\\r\\nsequence of events with tearful eyes to\\r\\nSangtila and displayed the samples to her.\\r\\nThe samples were really beautiful. Looking\\r\\nat them Sangtila said, “Don’t think that I\\r\\nam doing a favour for you. You have fineness\\r\\nin your hands. Don’t worry, I will provide a\\r\\njob for you.” Hearing this, Hechila quietly\\r\\n5thanked God. She was in disbelief that her\\r\\nprayers were answered so soon.\\r\\nSangtila handed over to Hechila a\\r\\nmekhala, design samples, beads, threads\\r\\nand many other such materials. She also\\r\\ngave her a deadline when Hechila is\\r\\nsupposed to complete the work and bring it\\r\\nto the boutique. Thereafter, everyday in the\\r\\nafternoon,\\r\\nH e c h i l a\\r\\nstarted her\\r\\nwork of\\r\\nappliqué. As\\r\\na result, the\\r\\no u t c o m e\\r\\nwas such\\r\\nthat, Hechila completed her work before the\\r\\ngiven date. Hechila was eagerly waiting for\\r\\nher first salary. On the said deadline, she\\r\\nreached the boutique and showed her work\\r\\nto Sangtila. Sangtila was quite happy at\\r\\n6Hechila’s work and asked Chuba, an\\r\\nemployee of the boutique, to pay her the\\r\\nrequisite amount of money.\\r\\nThis time Hechila took along a shawl with\\r\\nher. The bigger the work, the bigger is the\\r\\nmoney. This went on for quite a while. In\\r\\nthe meanwhile, Hechila admitted her\\r\\ndaughter in a school. Slowly she started\\r\\nsaving some amount of money after\\r\\nmeeting all her expenses. Appliqué was a\\r\\nhobby of Hechila. She was happy that her\\r\\nskill has helped her in the time of her need.\\r\\nThere were many instances when\\r\\nHechila collected her salary from Chuba\\r\\nwhen Sangtila was not around in the\\r\\nboutique. There were a number of times\\r\\nwhen Hechila felt that Chuba stared at her\\r\\nin an inappropriate manner, but she ignored\\r\\nhis stares. Soon there were times when\\r\\nChuba handed over her salary in such a way\\r\\nthat his hands touched hers. Hechila felt\\r\\n7uncomfortable at all these happenings but\\r\\nabstained from saying anything. She\\r\\nconsoled herself by thinking that these are\\r\\nmere accidents.\\r\\nChuba knew about the condition of\\r\\nHechila’s family. He knew that she was a\\r\\nhelpless lady. Now, Chuba started calling\\r\\nHechila in the boutique when Sangtila was\\r\\nnot around. There were many times when\\r\\nhe stood extremely close to her or tried to\\r\\nobstruct her way by standing at the doorway\\r\\nwhen Hechila moved out of the boutique.\\r\\nHechila had no other options since she had\\r\\nto draw her salary through Chuba only.\\r\\nHechila started getting depressed. She\\r\\nstarted despising the actions of Chuba. At\\r\\ntimes, she cried and wept at home alone.\\r\\nAt one instance, when Hechila visited the\\r\\nboutique with her works, only a few workers\\r\\nwere present. Taking advantage of the\\r\\nsituation, Chuba expressed his desire to\\r\\n8Hechila to\\r\\nhave physical\\r\\nrelationship\\r\\nwith her.\\r\\nHechila was\\r\\nshocked at\\r\\nthis indecent\\r\\nproposal of\\r\\nChuba. She\\r\\nran home\\r\\nwithout even taking her money. She was\\r\\nshivering with the fear that some kind of\\r\\ncrime was about to take place. She turned\\r\\npale. It was for the first time that such kind\\r\\nof statement was made to her.\\r\\nWhile Hechila was on her way to her\\r\\nhome, she coincidently met her neighbour,\\r\\nAunt Khumla. Hechila turned emotional when\\r\\nshe saw Aunt Khumla. On being asked by\\r\\nAunt Khumla the reason of Hechila being\\r\\nemotional, Hechila narrated the entire\\r\\n9incident that she had faced. She had fear in\\r\\nher mind as to what will happen in the near\\r\\nfuture. The next time she goes to collect\\r\\nher dues, what will Chuba say and do? Being\\r\\nfed up of these, she wanted to leave the\\r\\njob. Aunt Khumla told her not to be scared\\r\\nabout this matter. If she leaves this job what\\r\\nother alternative does she have? What\\r\\nguarantees her that there will be no people\\r\\nlike Chuba in other jobs? Aunt Khumla\\r\\nfurther said that she came across an article\\r\\nin the newspaper that such kind of\\r\\nunwanted and unwarranted behaviours are\\r\\npunishable offences as per the law, which\\r\\nChuba deserves. Both of them then decided\\r\\nthat they will narrate the incident to Sangtila\\r\\nso that the other ladies in the boutique will\\r\\nbe spared from the same harassment from\\r\\nChuba.\\r\\nSangtila’s husband held a high\\r\\ndesignation in the Department of Police and\\r\\n10hence, she was aware of such laws. Chuba\\r\\ngot scared at the warning given by Sangtila.\\r\\nHe was deeply worried about his wife and\\r\\nchildren as to\\r\\nwho will be\\r\\nlooking after\\r\\nthem if he will\\r\\nbe put\\r\\nbehind bars.\\r\\nHe started\\r\\nbegging for\\r\\nforgiveness\\r\\nto Sangtila and said,\\r\\n“Henceforth, I will not commit such an\\r\\noffence in the future”.\\r\\nSangtila wanted to give Chuba a second\\r\\nchance, since this was the first time that he\\r\\nwas found guilty of such offence. However,\\r\\nto make him realise the gravity of his\\r\\noffence, she wanted him to meet her\\r\\nhusband the next day. Having no other\\r\\nalternative, Chuba agreed to do so.\\r\\n11The next day, Chuba was presented\\r\\nbefore Sangtila’s husband. Her husband\\r\\nattended to the matter very seriously. He\\r\\ntold Chuba that in today’s world, terrible and\\r\\ndreadful crime\\r\\nagainst women\\r\\nstarts from\\r\\nsuch small\\r\\nincidents. The\\r\\nm a t t e r\\r\\nworsens by\\r\\nthe day.\\r\\nT o d a y\\r\\nwomen have\\r\\ncome out of their homes and started\\r\\nworking. Men should try to understand their\\r\\nconditions. Men have no right to make\\r\\nfriendship against their wishes. For a\\r\\nwoman, her dignity is of the highest\\r\\nimportance, which even men should try to\\r\\nprotect.\\r\\n12Sangtila warned Chuba, “This is your first\\r\\noffence, so I will give you a chance to correct\\r\\nand improve yourself. Henceforth, your\\r\\nbehaviour towards Hechila should be a\\r\\nrespectable one or else you will be behind\\r\\nthe bars.” Chuba, with regretful tears in his\\r\\neyes, asked for forgiveness from Sangtila\\r\\nand Hechila.\\r\\nAll this while, Hechila had been listening\\r\\nto all these discussions. She was surprised\\r\\nthat the government had introduced so\\r\\nmany laws for preserving the dignity of a\\r\\nwoman and she was not aware of any of it.\\r\\nKnowing all these, a new kind of strength\\r\\nkindled within herself. She is now confident\\r\\nthat she, along with her children, can live a\\r\\nlife of honour and dignity in this unknown\\r\\nworld. Hechila bowed to God in reverence\\r\\nonce again and thanked the Almighty for\\r\\nhis never ending grace.\\r\\n————\\r\\n13Provisions against Sexual\\r\\nHarassment\\r\\n♦\\r\\nThe Sexual Harassment of Women at\\r\\nWorkplace (Prevention, Prohibition and\\r\\nRedressal) Act, 2013, came into force\\r\\non February 2013.\\r\\n♦\\r\\nThis law is also applicable to women\\r\\nworking at homes (maid-servants).\\r\\n♦\\r\\nAs per the law, the accused should be\\r\\npunished within 90 days and failure to\\r\\ndo so by the office will attract penalty.\\r\\n♦\\r\\nIf harassment at workplace has not\\r\\nstopped or the accused are not\\r\\npunished, then the punishment will\\r\\nkeep on becoming harsher.

DEPARTMENT\\r\\n******\\r\\nNo.LJ(B). 114/2002/Pt/125 Dated Shillong, the 28th February, 2017.\\r\\nC E R T I F I C A T E\\r\\nThis is to certify that the Law Department, Govenment of\\r\\nMeghalaya has vetted the Legal Literacy Materials consisting of 11 booklets\\r\\nand 11 folders in English Language. These material are found to be\\r\\nsatisfactory and would be of immense use in disseminating legal awareness\\r\\nto the grassroots level in the State.\\r\\nDate: 28.02.2017 ( S.K. Sangma )\\r\\nUnder Secretary to the Govt. of Meghalaya,\\r\\nLaw Department.\\r\\n****STORY ON RIGHT TO INFORMATION\\r\\nThe village of Chungmoi is a small one;\\r\\nwith roughly 50 houses and one primary\\r\\nschool. The school, and their teacher,\\r\\nMr. Hopong’s house are made of tin while\\r\\nall the other houses in the village are thatch\\r\\nroofed.\\r\\nThe Public Work Department (PWD),\\r\\nwanting to build a road through the edge of\\r\\ntheir village, made provisions for acquiring\\r\\nthe required measurements for the\\r\\ndevelopment of the road. Of what land they\\r\\nuse for the construction of the said road,\\r\\nthey promised all the necessary\\r\\ncompensation to the affected villagers.\\r\\nOn the 22nd of March, there was a public\\r\\nannouncement in the evening stating that\\r\\nthe compensation money would be\\r\\ndistributed the following morning and that\\r\\neveryone who was to receive it was to report\\r\\n1to the teacher, Mr. Hopong’s house to collect\\r\\ntheir share.\\r\\nThe next day, as announced, all the land\\r\\nowners assembled at Mr. Hopong’s house.\\r\\nTwo persons accompanied the P.W.D. head\\r\\nand the Sub-Divisional Officer (SDO); the\\r\\npeople in charge of handing out the money\\r\\nsat at a table and all who were to receive\\r\\nthe compensation money were seated facing\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n2Standing up, the S.D.O said, “The land\\r\\nwe are taking from you is unequal and\\r\\nvarying in size. However, the difference is\\r\\nnot too vast, and since calculating each and\\r\\nevery person’s land is all too big a task in\\r\\nitself, we have taken an average on the\\r\\ncompen-sation amount to be paid to each\\r\\nof you. We will be giving everyone here a\\r\\nsum of Rs. 20,000 for his land.” “Your names\\r\\nand the amount you are to receive have\\r\\nbeen written here and each of you will have\\r\\nto give his signature next to his name. If\\r\\nyou are unable to write, your thumb print\\r\\nwill be sufficient,” he continued. The people\\r\\nobliged and did as instructed, with every\\r\\nperson receiving his share of the money.\\r\\nIn Chungmoi, there was a person who\\r\\nwas strictly against corruption. His name\\r\\nwas, Mr. Awang. On learning about the\\r\\nmethod of the distribution of the\\r\\ncompensation money, Mr. Awang had a\\r\\nhunch about it. He asked Mrs. Apoung who\\r\\n3was one of the land owners who received\\r\\nthe compensation about the matter. She\\r\\n(Mrs. Apoung) is a person who is very\\r\\nparticular about things. Listening attentively\\r\\nto what Mrs. Apoung said, Mr. Awang\\r\\nadviced her to make an inquiry on the matter\\r\\nunder Right To Information (RTI).\\r\\nMrs. Apoung had never heard of the concept\\r\\nbefore. He told her the meaning and the\\r\\nworkings of R.T.I. He explained to her that\\r\\nR.T.I (Right to Information), is a device\\r\\nwhich enabled\\r\\ncitizens to have\\r\\nthe necessary\\r\\ninformation on\\r\\nthings done by\\r\\nthe government\\r\\nto maintain\\r\\ntransparency and\\r\\ncurb corruption.\\r\\nHe continued by\\r\\ntelling her that\\r\\n4whatever inquiry made, will be answered\\r\\nwithin a period of 30 days failure to which,\\r\\nthe party under inquiry will be prosecuted.\\r\\nNothing is kept secret from the public unless\\r\\nit is valuable information threatening\\r\\nNational security.\\r\\n“Thank you. After hearing what you have\\r\\nsaid, I have a feeling that something is not\\r\\nright here. I will inform the others about it\\r\\n5and we shall file an R.T.I inquiry with your\\r\\nhelp”, said Mrs. Apoung.\\r\\nThen the landowners of Chungmoi village\\r\\nwent to the District Headquarter P.W.D Office\\r\\nand searched for the Public Information\\r\\nOfficer (P.I.O). On finding him, they handed\\r\\nhim the inquiry letter and the Rs. 10 fee.\\r\\nThey were informed that it would take 30\\r\\ndays for them to receive the information.\\r\\nThe appellate authority of the public\\r\\nauthority shall dispose of the appeal within\\r\\na period of thirty days or in exceptional\\r\\ncases within 45 days of the receipt of the\\r\\nappeal.\\r\\nAfter investigation, it was found out that\\r\\nthe landowners got only half of the allotted\\r\\nmoney for their land compensation, and the\\r\\nmoney to be given each person also varied\\r\\naccording to the size of land used for the\\r\\nconstruction site. Also, names of people who\\r\\ndid not belong to the village were found\\r\\n6written on the list which stated that they\\r\\nwere paid the money.\\r\\nThe amount sanctioned by the\\r\\ngovernment was Rs. 5,00,000 but what the\\r\\npeople of Chungmoi received was only\\r\\nRs. 2,00,000 and that to the unknown\\r\\nnames was Rs. 1,00,000. The missing\\r\\nRs. 2,00,000 was not recorded. The\\r\\ngovernment launched an investigation\\r\\nagainst the culprits of this misdemeanour.\\r\\n7It was found that the P.W.D Minister\\r\\npocketed Rs. 2,00,000. Their modus\\r\\noperandi was such that the minister called\\r\\nhis subordinate officer and told him this, “For\\r\\nthe Government work, Rs. 2,00,000 is\\r\\nrequired. Quickly send that money. The\\r\\nremaining Rs. 3,00,000, distributed as per\\r\\nyour discretion.”\\r\\nOf the Rs. 5,00,000, the minister took\\r\\nRs. 2,00,000, the land owners of Chungmoi\\r\\nreceived Rs. 2,00,000, and the remaining\\r\\nRs. 1,00,000 was written off to the names\\r\\nof the people who were not residents of the\\r\\nvillage of Chungmoi. The S.D.O, their cashier\\r\\nand the Minister in charge where punished\\r\\nas per the law. All the money that they\\r\\nwrongfully took from the people, they were\\r\\nforced to repay the full amount and by the\\r\\ncommand of the court, all the people found\\r\\nguilty were put behind bars.\\r\\n8After this, all the land owners of\\r\\nChungmoi received the due amount which\\r\\nthey were each allotted and each of them\\r\\nalso upgraded from their thatch roof houses\\r\\nto houses with roofs made of tin. The\\r\\nwidowed Mrs. Apoung received the largest\\r\\namount of money. With that money, she\\r\\nconstructed the biggest house in their\\r\\nvillage.\\r\\n*************\\r\\n**********\\r\\n*******\\r\\n***\\r\\n9  \n",

E R T I F I C A T E\\r\\nThis is to certify that the Law Department, Govenment of\\r\\nMeghalaya has vetted the Legal Literacy Materials consisting of 11 booklets\\r\\nand 11 folders in English Language. These material are found to be\\r\\nsatisfactory and would be of immense use in disseminating legal awareness\\r\\nto the grassroots level in the State.\\r\\nDate: 28.02.2017 ( S.K. Sangma )\\r\\nUnder Secretary to the Govt. of Meghalaya,\\r\\nLaw Department.\\r\\n****The Protection of Women from\\r\\nDomestic Violence Act, 2005\\r\\nShongmu was preparing her daughter\\r\\nApoung for school. Apoung asked for money\\r\\nto pay her school fees. Shongmu went to\\r\\nher and asked him the required amount of\\r\\nmoney to pay the school fees. This enraged\\r\\nher husband. He started abusing and\\r\\nscreaming at Shongmu and said, “Does\\r\\nmoney bloom in plants that I will pluck and\\r\\nbring to you? What great will we achieve by\\r\\neducating her so much? Teach her the daily\\r\\n1household chores. They will be more useful\\r\\nto her. I don’t have extra money to waste.\\r\\nGo from here and start preparing my\\r\\nbreakfast.”\\r\\nA couple of days later, Shongmu once\\r\\nagain asked her husband some money to\\r\\npurchase some grocery items. To this, her\\r\\nhusband replied, “You ask for money all the\\r\\ntime. It seems you spend a lot of money. I\\r\\nremember that only a few days back, you\\r\\ntook some money from me. Did you spend\\r\\nall of it? Your parents have not gifted me a\\r\\nbig corpus of funds from which I can remit\\r\\nyou money daily. God! In whose company\\r\\nhave I fallen into?”\\r\\nShongmu always had to rely on her\\r\\nhusband for all her requirement, both small\\r\\nand big. Her husband always insulted her\\r\\nwhenever she sought financial help. He\\r\\nabused her and harassed her mentally. He\\r\\nnot only abused her but also her parents.\\r\\n2One day, things went out of hand. Her\\r\\nhusband was drunk when he returned home\\r\\nat night. Shongmu was setting the dinner\\r\\ntable. Her husband became angry at the\\r\\nsight of the food and screamed at her, “What\\r\\nkind of food is this? I give you so much\\r\\nmoney to make purchases and yet you give\\r\\nme such kind of food.”\\r\\n3With the mixture of anger and\\r\\nintoxication, he forcefully threw his dish from\\r\\nthe table. The dish hit Shongmu and all her\\r\\nclothes were soiled with the food. To make\\r\\nmatters worse, the dish hit her face and\\r\\nhead. The impact was so great that she was\\r\\ninjured and her head started to bleed.\\r\\nHowever, her husband was intoxicated; he\\r\\ndid not notice what had happened. Instead\\r\\nhe held her by her hair and started to\\r\\nphysically abuse and manhandled her. He\\r\\nalso threw her out of the house.\\r\\n4Shongmu stood outside the house and\\r\\npleaded with her husband to let her in.\\r\\nHowever, her husband did not let her in.\\r\\nInstead he said, “Go away from here. From\\r\\ntoday onwards you have no relation to this\\r\\nhouse.” Shongmu’s neighbour, Khumla\\r\\nnoticed Shongmu in that condition and she\\r\\ntook her to her home. She attended to her\\r\\nwounds and said, “How could you bear such\\r\\natrocities? Are you going to live your entire\\r\\nlife like this?”\\r\\n5Shongmu replied, “Fate has this in store\\r\\nfor me. I carry out all the household activities\\r\\nthe whole day, but he treats me like his slave.\\r\\nMy only duties are to prepare food for the\\r\\nfamily, washing clothes, sending the children\\r\\nto school and tend to all his needs.”\\r\\nKhumla said, “No, it is not like that.\\r\\nYesterday, I went to the Anganwadi meeting.\\r\\nThere one madam came. She said that a\\r\\nlaw has been enacted for women. That law\\r\\nis known as The Protection of Women from\\r\\nDomestic Violence Act, 2005. We will seek\\r\\nhelp under this law.”\\r\\nThe next morning, Khumla took\\r\\nShongmu to an official. The official is known\\r\\nas Protection Officer in all the places.\\r\\nShongmu narrated all the past incidents and\\r\\nexperiences through which she went\\r\\nthrough. The Protection Officer listened to\\r\\nher very carefully. The Protection Officer who\\r\\nwas a lady said, “This law is made for\\r\\nwomen like you who are victim to such\\r\\n6atrocities. As per this law, your husband will\\r\\nbe called and we will make him understand.\\r\\nIf he does not conform to what we say, then\\r\\nyou can file a case against him. We will help\\r\\nyou in every possible ways.”\\r\\nThe lady Protection Officer handed over\\r\\na form to Shongmu which is known as D.I.R.\\r\\n(Domestic Incident Report). This form\\r\\ncontains the description of the types of\\r\\n7violence against women. The victimised\\r\\nwomen should describe the type of violence\\r\\nthat has taken place against her. In case\\r\\nthe victimised woman is not educated, then\\r\\nthe Protection Officer himself/herself reads\\r\\nthe form to her so that she can describe the\\r\\ntype of violence that she has undergone\\r\\nthrough.\\r\\nBy this process the D.I.R. Form of\\r\\nShongmu was filled and her husband was\\r\\ncalled for reconciliation.\\r\\nThis law is designed to make homes\\r\\nrather than breaking homes.\\r\\nThe Protection of Women from\\r\\nDomestic Violence Act, 2005\\r\\nThe Protection of Women from\\r\\nDomestic Act, 2005 has been introduced to\\r\\nprotect the rights of women who are victims\\r\\nof family violence.\\r\\n8This is a Civil Law for more effective\\r\\nprotection of the rights of women (wives,\\r\\nmothers, sisters, daughters, single women\\r\\netc.) who are victims of violence of any kind\\r\\noccurring within the family and for matters\\r\\nconnected herewith or incidental thereto\\r\\nwhich includes physical abuse, mental\\r\\nabuse, sexual abuse, verbal and emotional\\r\\nabuse and economic abuse.\\r\\nImportant Provisions of this Law\\r\\n1.

(B) DEPARTMENT\\r\\n******\\r\\nNo.LJ(B). 114/2002/Pt/125 Dated Shillong, the 28th February, 2017.\\r\\nC E R T I F I C A T E\\r\\nThis is to certify that the Law Department, Govenment of\\r\\nMeghalaya has vetted the Legal Literacy Materials consisting of 11 booklets\\r\\nand 11 folders in English Language. These material are found to be\\r\\nsatisfactory and would be of immense use in disseminating legal awareness\\r\\nto the grassroots level in the State.\\r\\nDate: 28.02.2017 ( S.K. Sangma )\\r\\nUnder Secretary to the Govt. of Meghalaya,\\r\\nLaw Department.\\r\\n****End of Atrocities\\r\\nLikokba was a poor farmer. He belonged\\r\\nto the Scheduled Caste community. He had\\r\\ntwo acres of agricultural land beside the\\r\\nstreet, near the river. Near Likokba’s land,\\r\\nthere was a land of Imlong, an affluent man\\r\\nof the village, which was located towards\\r\\nthe back side of Likokba’s land.\\r\\nLikokba was married to Menang. He was\\r\\nblessed with a son named Awang and a\\r\\n1daughter named Khumla. They all dwelled\\r\\nin a small hut erected on his agricultural land.\\r\\nLikokba’s daughter was about to get\\r\\nmarried for which he was in need of money.\\r\\nTo seek financial help, he went to Imlong.\\r\\nHe asked Imlong to lend him some money\\r\\nas a loan. Imlong agreed to provide the loan\\r\\nto Likokba at once. However, Imlong’s\\r\\nintentions were not right. He always wanted\\r\\nto grab Likokba’s land by any means so that\\r\\nhis land will be connected with the street\\r\\nthat runs beside Likokba’s land.\\r\\nImlong considered this as a golden\\r\\nopportunity for him. He said to Likokba,\\r\\n“Likokba, I will provide you money, but you\\r\\nhave to carry out the formalities in the\\r\\ngovernment office.” Khumla’s marriage was\\r\\nin the next month and Likokba was in dire\\r\\nneed of money. As Likokba was not\\r\\neducated, he believed Imlong and agreed\\r\\nto do what Imlong had said.\\r\\n2Imlong lent the money to Likokba at the\\r\\ngovernment office. He prepared some\\r\\ndocument and took Likokba’s thumb\\r\\nimpression on the documents.\\r\\nLikokba’s daughter Khumla was married\\r\\nto Hopong. During that year, there was a\\r\\ngood harvest of wheat in Likokba’s field. He\\r\\nsold his wheat in the wholesale market for\\r\\nfarmer’s agricultural produce. The wheat\\r\\nwas sold at good rate. Since Likokba had\\r\\nsurplus money, he, along with his brother\\r\\nMandok, went to Imlong to pay off the loan\\r\\namount along with the interest.\\r\\n3Likokba asked Imlong for the documents\\r\\nwherein he had put his thumb impression\\r\\nwhile taking the money. Imlong, deffered\\r\\nthe matter and gave the excuse that he will\\r\\nhave to search for the documents. He\\r\\nassured Likokba that he will return him the\\r\\ndocuments after finding them. As Likokba\\r\\nand Mandok were innocent and illiterate\\r\\nfarmers, they believed Imlong and the\\r\\nmatter was left there itself.\\r\\nMonsoon was soon approaching and\\r\\ntime has come to till the soil once again.\\r\\nLikokba went to plough his field and sow\\r\\nthe seeds for the upcoming season.\\r\\nWhen Likokba entered his field, he saw\\r\\nthe servants of Imlong were standing on\\r\\nhis field. When the servants saw Likokba,\\r\\nthey did not allow Likokba to plough his field\\r\\nand chased him away from his land. Imlong’s\\r\\nservants then started sowing the seeds with\\r\\nthe help of a tractor that belonged to\\r\\n4Imlong. Likokba was perplexed and could\\r\\nnot understand what was going on. He then\\r\\napproached Imlong to enquire about the\\r\\nmatter. Likokba asked Imlong, “You have\\r\\nnot returned me the documents where I put\\r\\nmy thumb impression on, even though I had\\r\\nrepaid the money that I borrowed from you.\\r\\nNow what are your servants doing in my\\r\\nland? Why are they sowing seeds in my land\\r\\nwith your tractor?”\\r\\nImlong replied in anger, “Likokba, you\\r\\nhave sold your land to me. You are no longer\\r\\n5the owner of the land. If you ever set foot\\r\\non my land, I will kill you.”\\r\\nLikokba got scared at the threat of\\r\\nImlong. He started crying and pleaded for\\r\\nmercy. With folded hands, Likokba said,\\r\\n“Soon after harvesting my crops and selling\\r\\nthem, I had returned the money that I owed\\r\\nto you in front of Mandok as a witness.\\r\\nHowever, you had not returned the\\r\\ndocuments of the loan. Moreover, you have\\r\\neven tried to deviate from the matter. For\\r\\nGod’s sake, please don’t be dishonest.”\\r\\nOn hearing this Imlong furiously said,\\r\\n“Are you going to fight with me? Someone\\r\\nthrow him out of my house.”\\r\\nPoor Likokba had no other option. He\\r\\nwept and cried and came back to his home.\\r\\nOn his way, Likokba met the Village Council\\r\\nChairman. On seeing Likokba crying, he\\r\\nenquired as to what the matter was.\\r\\n6Likokba narrated the entire incident to the\\r\\nVillage Council Chairman with tearful eyes.\\r\\nThe Village Council Chairman listened to him\\r\\nvery carefully. He regained Likokba’s\\r\\ncomposure and instilled courage in Likokba\\r\\nand said, “You need not worry. Have courage.\\r\\nThe government has provided special\\r\\nfacilities and rights to the people belonging\\r\\nto Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.\\r\\nPeople belonging to Scheduled Castes or\\r\\nScheduled Tribes will receive justice, free of\\r\\ncost, through special courts. You will get back\\r\\nyour land and Imlong will be put behind bars.”\\r\\n7The Village Council Chairman took\\r\\nLikokba to the police station where Likokba\\r\\nnarrated the entire story. The policeman,\\r\\nafter hearing from Likokba as to how his\\r\\nland has been snatched, said, “Wrongfully\\r\\ndispossessing a member of a Scheduled\\r\\nCaste or Scheduled Tribe from his land by\\r\\nany person will be considered as an offence.\\r\\nPreparing fraud documents is a legal crime\\r\\nwhich leads to severe penalty or\\r\\nimprisonment. You lodge an FIR. Imlong will\\r\\nbe punished for his misdoings.”\\r\\nThe policeman further told Likokba, “The\\r\\ntrial of your case will be in a special court.\\r\\nYou don’t have to pay the legal charges and\\r\\nthe lawyer’s fees. The Government of India\\r\\nhas provided these facilities to the people\\r\\nbelonging to Scheduled Castes or Scheduled\\r\\nTribes so that they can live their life with\\r\\nhonour and dignity. As per this law, Imlong\\r\\nwill not be granted bail. You will receive your\\r\\nfarm land back. We will protect your land.”\\r\\n8in his land and soon the seeds bloomed into\\r\\nabundant greenery. Likokba and his family\\r\\nwere delighted to see the abundant crop in\\r\\ntheir field. They started living a normal and\\r\\nhappy life. The police official who helped\\r\\nLikokba often comes and inquires about his\\r\\ndaily state of affairs. He too was pleased\\r\\nthat Likokba is now leading a normal life.\\r\\n10The Scheduled Castes and the\\r\\nScheduled Tribes (Prevention of\\r\\nAtrocities) Act, 1989\\r\\nPeople belonging to the Scheduled\\r\\nCastes and the Scheduled Tribes have the\\r\\nright of equality in the society. It is the\\r\\nresponsibility of the law to stop and prevent\\r\\natrocities and crimes on them. For this, the\\r\\ngovernment has introduced a law named\\r\\nThe Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled\\r\\nTribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989.\\r\\nList of members of Scheduled Castes/\\r\\nScheduled Tribes\\r\\nThe government has prepared a special\\r\\nlist of the most backward castes with the\\r\\naim of economic and social growth of these\\r\\npeople.

Department, Govenment of\\r\\nMeghalaya has vetted the Legal Literacy Materials consisting of 11 booklets\\r\\nand 11 folders in English Language. These material are found to be\\r\\nsatisfactory and would be of immense use in disseminating legal awareness\\r\\nto the grassroots level in the State.\\r\\nDate: 28.02.2017 ( S.K. Sangma )\\r\\nUnder Secretary to the Govt. of Meghalaya,\\r\\nLaw Department.\\r\\n****(Pongtang Gets Justice)\\r\\nPongtang was a labourer in Noksen\\r\\nVillage. His family comprised of his wife\\r\\nSepila, daughter Shongmu and son Mandok.\\r\\nPongtang’s aged father and mother also\\r\\nlived with him. Pongtang and Sepila used to\\r\\nwork in farms to earn their family’s\\r\\nlivelihood.\\r\\nA farmer named Hemyen lived in\\r\\nPongtang’s neighbourhood. He had five\\r\\nacres of land in the village. He used to call\\r\\nPongtang and Sepila for tending the crops.\\r\\nHowever, Pongtang and Sepila never went\\r\\nto work in Hemyen’s farm because Hemyen\\r\\nalways looked at Sepila in an obscene and\\r\\nlewd manner, which made Sepila\\r\\nuncomfortable. Once, Pongtang and Sepila\\r\\nwent to Hemyen’s farm to sow some seeds.\\r\\nWhile working, Hemyen sent Pongtang to\\r\\nfetch the plough from Hemyen’s house. At\\r\\n1that moment Hemyen started teasing and\\r\\ntaunting Sepila.\\r\\nFrom that\\r\\ni n c i d e n t\\r\\no n w a r d s ,\\r\\nPongtang and\\r\\nSepila stopped\\r\\ngoing to\\r\\nHemyen’s farm\\r\\nfor any kind of\\r\\nwork. Due to this\\r\\nreason, Hemyen\\r\\nwanted to seek\\r\\nvengeance on\\r\\nthem.\\r\\nOne day, a rich man’s jewels were stolen\\r\\nin the village. The rich man lodged an FIR in\\r\\nthe Police Station regarding the theft, after\\r\\nwhich the police started investigating the\\r\\nmatter in the village.\\r\\n2Hemyen wanted to take advantage of\\r\\nthis situation. He planned to falsely accuse\\r\\nPongtang of this theft so that when Pongtang\\r\\nis put behind bars, Sepila will approach him\\r\\nto seek help since the Sub-Divisional lawyer,\\r\\nChaushak often visits Hemyen.\\r\\nDuring the course of their investigation\\r\\nwhen the police approached Hemyen,\\r\\nHemyen said, “It is Pongtang who has stolen\\r\\nthe jewels.”\\r\\nThe police went to Pongtang’s House and\\r\\nfound some of the stolen jewels in front of\\r\\nhis house. The police confiscated the jewels\\r\\nand prepared a confiscation report. The\\r\\npolice became suspicious of Pongtang. They\\r\\nsearched the entire house of Pongtang but\\r\\ndid not find anything. However, they\\r\\narrested Pongtang. Following the arrest,\\r\\nSepila and his aged parents became scared\\r\\nand anxious. Sepila said, “Who will save my\\r\\nhusband from being imprisoned? We neither\\r\\n3have money to spend nor to pay the fees of\\r\\nany lawyer.”\\r\\nHearing the words of Sepila, her son\\r\\nImlong said, “Mother, you need not worry.\\r\\nI have seen a board near the bus stand\\r\\nregarding free legal assistance and\\r\\nconsultancy. There, two lawyers were\\r\\ntalking to the Village Council Chairman. They\\r\\nwere saying that the government has made\\r\\nprovisions to provide justice to the poor\\r\\n4villagers. Let us go to that office and try to\\r\\nfree our father.”\\r\\nHearing this, Sepila’s fear receded a bit.\\r\\nShe went to the Free Legal Assistance and\\r\\nConsultancy Centre and met the lawyer.\\r\\nThe next day, the police presented\\r\\nPongtang in the court before the judge.\\r\\nThe judge started interrogating\\r\\nPongtang. Pongtang pleaded that he is\\r\\ninnocent and that\\r\\nthe theft was not\\r\\ncarried out by\\r\\nhim. He further\\r\\nsaid that he is\\r\\nfalsely accused of\\r\\nthe theft and the\\r\\npolice forcefully\\r\\narrested him. He\\r\\nand his family\\r\\nearn their\\r\\nlivelihood by hard\\r\\nwork and not by\\r\\n5wrong means. He said that he has not stolen\\r\\nanything and the stolen items are not in his\\r\\npossession.\\r\\nThe judge asked Pongtang, “Do you have\\r\\na lawyer to fight for your case and provide\\r\\nyou justice?”\\r\\nPongtang replied, “We are poor and\\r\\nilliterate. How can we fight a case? We don’t\\r\\nhave any money to pay for a lawyer. When\\r\\nwill you set me free from the prison? I have\\r\\nto go for my daily work to run my family.\\r\\nThe judge carefully listened to his words\\r\\nand then he said, “We will provide you a\\r\\nlawyer at the expense of the government.”\\r\\nThe lawyer from the Free Legal\\r\\nAssistance and Consultancy Centre\\r\\nappeared before the judge. His wife Sepila\\r\\nand his son Mandok were also present with\\r\\nthe lawyer.\\r\\n6The lawyer immediately presented the\\r\\npapers for Pongtang’s bail. He told all the\\r\\ntruth about the case to the judge and asked\\r\\nthe judge to release him on bail.\\r\\nThe judge approved the bail plea of\\r\\nPongtang.\\r\\n7Since the police filed a case against\\r\\nPongtang, the lawyer from the Free Legal\\r\\nAssistance and Consultancy Centre fought for\\r\\nPongtang. He finally argued that Pongtang is\\r\\ninnocent. The stolen items were not recovered\\r\\nfrom him and the police also failed to present\\r\\nany witness or proof against Pongtang.\\r\\nConsidering all the facts, proofs and\\r\\nwitnesses of the case and the arguments of\\r\\nthe lawyers, the judge passed the\\r\\njudgement that there is no proof against\\r\\nPongtang and he should be set free.\\r\\nFree Legal Assistance and\\r\\nConsultancy\\r\\nEvery citizen has the right to get justice.\\r\\nPoor and illiterate people cannot afford to\\r\\npay lawyer’s fee as well as other legal\\r\\nexpenses.

Everyone\\r\\nis going towards the Village Council. People\\r\\nare expecting Chila, a female lawyer from\\r\\n1the city. The Chairman of the Village Council\\r\\nis a gentleman by the name of Showba. He\\r\\nhas been telling the people that the lawyer\\r\\nwill be discussing about the Law of Forest\\r\\nRights. This law has been enacted to protect\\r\\nthe rights of the tribal people who dwell in\\r\\nforests. This law also covers the rights of\\r\\nother traditional forest dwellers.\\r\\nWhile Showba, the Chairman of the\\r\\nVillage Council, has been talking about all\\r\\nthese to the villagers, the lawyer, Chila\\r\\narrived at the gathering of the village council.\\r\\nEverybody welcomed her with respect.\\r\\nThereafter, Chila began her talk. She said,\\r\\n“All of you who have gathered here are\\r\\nScheduled Tribes and Other Traditional\\r\\nDwellers who have been dwelling in forests\\r\\nfor centuries together. You all have always\\r\\ntrusted and contibuted greatly towards the\\r\\nprotection of the forests. The forest is your\\r\\nhome and if your home does not get the\\r\\n2appropriate rights, it will be a big injustice\\r\\ndone to you all.”\\r\\nShe continued, “Among you all were\\r\\nthose tribes who had been compelled to\\r\\nforego their homes in the name of\\r\\ndevelopment and had to settle in some other\\r\\nplace. Insecurity related to land has been a\\r\\nproblem which has been continuing for a\\r\\nlong time. To curb this menace, Forest\\r\\nRights Act, 2006 and Rules 2008 have been\\r\\nframed.” All the forest dwellers present at\\r\\n3the gathering were listening very carefully\\r\\nto Chila.\\r\\nHopong said: “Madam Lawyer, what\\r\\nbenefit will we get from this law?”\\r\\nChila replied: “This is a valid question.\\r\\nIn this Forest Rights Act, the Scheduled\\r\\nTribes and other forest dwellers have been\\r\\ngiven some legal rights:\\r\\n All tribal dwellers who have been residing\\r\\nin the forest earlier than 2005, shall\\r\\nreceive land rights documents.\\r\\n4 All other traditional forest dwellers who\\r\\nhave been residing in the forest for three\\r\\ngenerations (seventy five years) will also\\r\\nreceive land rights documents.\\r\\n Right of ownership shall also be given\\r\\nfor village, habitat and community forest\\r\\nland.”\\r\\nImlong asked – “Are lands under\\r\\ncommunity rights also included under this\\r\\nLaw?”\\r\\nChila replies – “Yes, rights of land under\\r\\ncommunity rights will be given to forests\\r\\ndwellers as per rules of the State.\\r\\n Forest rights will also be given to forest\\r\\ndwelling Schedules Tribes and other\\r\\ntraditional forest dwellers on other\\r\\ncommunity rights of uses or entitlements\\r\\nsuch as fish and other products of water\\r\\nbodies.\\r\\n The forest dwelling Schedules Tribes and\\r\\nother traditional forest dwellers shall have\\r\\n5the right of access to collect, use and\\r\\ndispose of minor forest produce such as\\r\\nbamboo, brush wood, stumps, cane,\\r\\ncocoons, honey, wax, lac, or leaves,\\r\\nmedicinal plants and herbs, roots, tubers,\\r\\nstones, chips and the like.\\r\\n Forest dwelling Scheduled Tribes and\\r\\nother traditional forest dwellers shall have\\r\\nthe rights to transport the minor forest\\r\\nproduce from the forest to villages and\\r\\nmarket through head loading, bicycle or\\r\\nhand cart.\\r\\n No licences shall be issued on water\\r\\nbodies without the permission of the\\r\\ncommunity.”\\r\\nMenang asked – “Can forest land be\\r\\nutilised for any other purpose?”\\r\\nChila replied – “The Village Council has\\r\\nthe right for diversion of forest land for the\\r\\nfacilities like schools; dispensaries or\\r\\nhospital; anganwadis; fair price shops;\\r\\n6tanks and other minor water bodies; electric\\r\\nlines, drinking water supply and water\\r\\npipelines; roads; skill upgradation or\\r\\nvocational training centres; community\\r\\ncentres. However, this should involve felling\\r\\nof trees not exceeding 75 trees.”\\r\\nFigure 1\\r\\n7Lithrongla was listening quietly up till\\r\\nnow. She also asked a question, “Who will\\r\\nhave the right over the habitat of the tribal\\r\\nforest dwellers?”\\r\\nChila replied – “The tribal forest dwellers\\r\\nwill get the right of ownership over their\\r\\nhabitat. They will have the rights of\\r\\nsettlement and conversion of all forest\\r\\nvillagers, old habitation, villages which are\\r\\n8not surveyed and other villages in forests\\r\\nwhether recorded, notified or not into\\r\\nrevenue villages.”\\r\\nIn today’s meeting, there are a lot of tribal\\r\\npeople who were forcefully removed from\\r\\ntheir lands. Among them was Takam. He\\r\\ngathered courage and asked, ‘Can the tribal\\r\\npeople who were displaced by the Forest\\r\\nDepartment come back and resettle in their\\r\\nown habitat?”\\r\\nChila could understand the pain of\\r\\nTakam. She said, “If the tribal people are\\r\\ndisplaced before 13th December, 2005 by\\r\\nthe Forest Department and if they have not\\r\\nbeen given compensation and they have not\\r\\nfound a place to dwell, then they can resettle\\r\\nin their previous dwelling place.\\r\\nIf the State plans to undertake certain\\r\\ndevelopmental projects and as a\\r\\nconsequence they need to acquire forest\\r\\nlands, the developmental project should kick\\r\\n9start in the acquired forest land within five\\r\\nyears of acquirement. At the time of\\r\\nacquiring the forest land, if the State had\\r\\nnot paid any compensation to the displaced\\r\\nforest dwellers and tribal people; and had\\r\\nnot made adequate arrangement for their\\r\\nrehabilitation; and the development project\\r\\nhave not started within 5 years of\\r\\nacquirement of the forest land, then the\\r\\n10displaced people will get the right to resettle\\r\\nin their original habitat.\\r\\nAny Scheduled Tribe and other\\r\\ntraditional forest dweller cannot be\\r\\ndisplaced from their original habitat until\\r\\nand unless the viability and validity of the\\r\\nproject is established and complete\\r\\ninvestigation of the same is carried out.”\\r\\nImlong asked – “Madam Lawyer, along\\r\\nwith our rights, what will be our duties?”\\r\\nChila answered –”In the Act, the duties\\r\\nof the Scheduled Tribe and traditional forest\\r\\ndwellers are also included along with their\\r\\nrights. The prime duties include the\\r\\nfollowing:\\r\\n Protect the wildlife, forest and\\r\\nbiodiversity.\\r\\n Ensure that adjoining catchment area,\\r\\nwater sources and other ecologically\\r\\nsensitive areas are adequately\\r\\nprotected.\\r\\n11 Ensure that the decisions taken in the\\r\\nVillage Council will regulate access to\\r\\ncommunity forest resources and stop\\r\\nany activity which adversely affects the\\r\\nwild animals, forest and the biodiversity\\r\\nare complied with.”\\r\\nHopong questioned – “At the Village\\r\\nCouncil level, a Forest Rights Committee\\r\\nwill be constituted in the first meeting of\\r\\nthe Village Council. At this meeting, two-\\r\\nthird of the members of the Village Council\\r\\nshould be present.”\\r\\nKhumla enquired – “The Forest Rights\\r\\nCommittee will consist of how many\\r\\nmembers?”\\r\\nChila said – “The committee will be\\r\\nconstituted by 10-15 members of the\\r\\nVillage Council, out of whom at least 5\\r\\nmembers should be tribal people and 5\\r\\nmembers should be women. The\\r\\nCommittee should have a Chairman/\\r\\n12President and a Secretary. There is a\\r\\nprovision to include the Village Council\\r\\nSecretary or any member of the Village\\r\\nCouncil in the post of Secretary in the Village\\r\\nRights Committee. It is not necessary to\\r\\ninclude the Chairman of the Village Council,\\r\\nmembers of the Village Council or any\\r\\ngovernment official in the Forest Rights\\r\\nCommittee.”\\r\\nHopong asked – “What do we have to\\r\\ndo to obtain the forest rights?”\\r\\nChila answered – “To obtain village\\r\\nrights, the tribal people and forest dwellers\\r\\nshould fill up the Claim Form of the Forest\\r\\nRights Committee.”\\r\\nHemyen asked – “How will the villagers\\r\\nclaim the rights on their forest lands?”\\r\\nChila replied – “The Village Council gives\\r\\nthe right to the Forest Rights Committee\\r\\nto receive claims. Thereafter the villagers\\r\\ncan submit their claims on the prescribed\\r\\n13Claim Form to the Forest Rights Committee\\r\\nin the Village Council Office. Along with the\\r\\napplication, the villagers should also submit\\r\\nproof of their occupancy on the said piece\\r\\nof land.”\\r\\nHe continued, “One of the copies of the\\r\\nclaim is kept with the committee and a seal\\r\\nof receipt is stamped on the other copy. The\\r\\n14villagers should keep the sealed copy with\\r\\nthem properly and safely.”\\r\\nHechila – “How is the resolution/\\r\\njudgement passed on the occupancy\\r\\nclaimed by the claimants?\\r\\nChila answered – “The Village Council will\\r\\ndetermine the eligibility of the claims raised\\r\\nby the claimants and forward it to the Sub-\\r\\nDivisional Level Committee. Thereafter, the\\r\\nSub-Divisional Level Committee will prepare\\r\\na report on the claims forwarded by the\\r\\nVillage Council and forward the same to the\\r\\nDistrict Committee for the final resolution/\\r\\njudgement.”\\r\\nChuba – “Who gives the final judgement\\r\\non the claims?”\\r\\nChila replied – “Committees at the district\\r\\nlevel gives the final judgement on all types\\r\\nof individual and public claims.

The evidences which can be\\r\\npresented are – Gazetteers, population\\r\\ncensus, map, forest records, patta or lease,\\r\\nany government order, notification,\\r\\ngovernment records, voter’s identity card,\\r\\n16ration card, judgement of court, records\\r\\nfrom erstwhile princely States or provinces\\r\\nand genealogy tracing ancestry to\\r\\nindividuals mentioned in earlier land records.\\r\\nThe Village Council will record all information\\r\\nin their register as per their rules. The Village\\r\\nCouncil will give the claimants an opportunity\\r\\nfor hearing on the issues related to Forest\\r\\nRights. Thereafter, the Village Council will\\r\\npass a resolution/judgement and will\\r\\n17forward the same to the Sub-Divisional Level\\r\\nCommittee.”\\r\\nChila then questioned – “What will a\\r\\nperson do if he/she is not satisfied with the\\r\\ndecision given/judgement passed by the\\r\\nVillage Council?”\\r\\nChila answered – “If any forest dwellers\\r\\nis not satisfied with the decision given/\\r\\njudgement passed by the Village Council,\\r\\nhe/she can file a petition to the Sub-\\r\\nDivisional Committee within 60 days of the\\r\\nresolution passed.

Both of them studied together and grew up together. One day Chila was engaged to get married. On hearing this news, Khandang had mixed feelings. She was happy as well as sad. She was happy because her friend is going to be settled and sad because both of them have to part from each other owing to their upcoming new lives. 1Within a few days Chila got married. Whenever Chila visited her maternal home, both Chila and Khandang used to talk for hours. Within their talks, Chila described her new family to Khandang while Khandang described the recent happenings in the village, the crops in the field and the threshing place. A year later, Chila came to her maternal home for maternal care. This time she was going to stay for a longer duration. Khandang was delighted at this. She often came to visit Chila. Chila was soon blessed with a beautiful daughter. However, her in-laws seemed a bit unhappy. On the other side, Khandang was extremely happy. To celebrate her happiness, Khandang prepared some 2laddoos (sweets) and took them to the hospital and distributed them to everyone. Looking at this, Khandang’s mother told Chila, “Chila, without you Khandang becomes very depressed but whenever you are by her side she gleams with happiness. Why don’t you look for a suitable groom for her and take her to your village? Thereafter, both of you can always be together.” 3Fate took such a turn that Khandang too got married to a person from the same village as that of Chila. Both of them were extremely happy. However, happiness was not there for long. There were a lot of restrictions in the house of the in-laws of Khandang. She was not allowed to meet anyone or go out of the house. Khandang often wondered as to when she will be able to meet Chila. 4One day both Chila and Khandang met each other in the Church. There, both of them decided that they will meet each other in the Church every Sunday evening. Both of them, then, eagerly waited for Sunday and when they met at the Church, they talked on a variety of topics. One Sunday evening, when both of them met in the Church, both of them looked sad. Unlike the other days, both of them did not look happy. Both of them sat at the steps of the Church and Chila told Khandang, “Khandang, I have something to tell you.” “Something is also troubling me too, Chila” said Khandang. “Troubling you? What is troubling you?” asked Chila. Khandang said, “First you. Let me know what you want to tell.” 5Chila replied, “No, first you. I would like to solve your problem first. Tell me what is troubling you?” Khandang then replied, “This ‘you first’, ‘you first’ will finally lead us to the time when we will be leaving for our homes. Alright let me tell you what is troubling me.” She continued, “Chila, about 4-5 days before I was very happy, when I learnt that I am going to become a mother. Every night I dreamt about the child and now my mother- in-law is about to take me to the doctor for a sex- determination test. My mother-in-law says that the first child should be a boy. I know that carrying out a sex-determination test is an offence. Do you remember that lady doctor who told us in school that determining the sex of the foetus is an offence? But how will I say this to my in- laws? What shall I do? Tell me.” 6On hearing this, Chila held her head and said, “My God! This thing was also running through my head. This was what I was going to say. Do you remember that everyone was displeased when a daughter was born to me? Everyone was chiding me and this time everyone in my family is asking me to go for a sex-determination test. I am really scared. If this time also I give birth to a daughter, then....? Are we going to commit this offence? Madam Doctor said that this is a crime. We will become criminals, Khandang.” Khandang showed a lot of conviction and said out rightly, “No Chila, whatever may be, we are not going to do anything wrong. The lady doctor from the city comes on Mondays only. Our family members will be taking us to her on that day. Think of something as to how can we be saved from this sin.” 7Both of them silently thought about this matter. Then Chila whispered into Khandang’s ears, “Have courage. We are two of us here.” Thereafter, both of them left for their own respective homes. On Monday, Chila’s mother -in-law took her to the hospital. While Chila was sitting on the bench and waiting for her turn, she was also waiting for Khandang’s arrival. A few moments later, Khandang arrived with her mother-in-law. The lady doctor also arrived at the hospital after sometime. Both Chila and Khandang were surprised to learn that the lady doctor is the same doctor who used to visit their school. They held each others’ hand and saw a ray of hope. Both of their fears vanished and they both gave a smile of relief. During the check up, Khandang’s mother-in-law was present with her. So, she 8was unable to say anything. However, when Chila got the chance, she told the doctor what was in her mind. The doctor consoled her and gestured to her to remain quiet. After a while, Chila’s mother-in-law slowly requested the doctor to carry out the sex- determination test. However, the doctor flatly refused to do so. The doctor also called in Khandang’s mother-in-law. Then she started explaining to both of them, “It is God 9who decides whether the child will be a boy or a girl. Pre-natal sex-determination is a punishable offence. Determination of sex of the foetus will result in punishment for you as well as for me....” In the meanwhile, when the doctor was explaining to both the mothers-in-law inside the chamber, the two close friends hugged each other outside with tears of joy. 10Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (Prohibition of Sex Selection) Act, 1994, amended 2003. A few years back, the technology for pre- natal sex determination was developed. This technology is useful in detecting and curing the physical and mental defects of the child in the womb. Moreover, with this technology other diseases of the foetus can be detected and the diseases can be cured. However, this technology has been misutilised. People have been using this technology to determine the sex/gender of the foetus. When people came to know that the foetus was that of a girl, they would go for forced abortion. As a result, the number of female foeticide cases began to rise. Due to this, the ratio of females to males (sex ratio) began to fall in a rapid pace. To curb 11with the dwindling sex ratio and misutilisation of the technology, an Act was enacted. The Act is known as The Pre- Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (Prohibition of Sex Selection) Act, 1994, as amended in 2003. As per the provisions of this Act, any laboratory, testing/examination centre or clinic is restricted from determining the sex of the foetus. According to this Act, determination of the sex of the foetus is allowed only in certain special conditions. Pre-Natal Diagnostic Tests are considered legal only in the following conditions: ♦ The child in the womb has chromosomal irregularity/abnormality. ♦ The pregnant woman has undergone two or more spontaneous abortions. 12♦ The age of the pregnant woman is above 35 years. ♦ The pregnant woman had been exposed to potentially teratogenic agents such as drugs, radiation, infection or chemicals, which may result in physical deformities or mental retardation of the child. ♦ The pregnant woman or her spouse has a family history of mental retardation or physical deformities such as, spasticity or any other genetic disease Penalties as per the Act ♦ If any person goes for sex determination test wilfully or under pressure, then he or she will be deemed as guilty. The penalties for the offence is imprisonment for a term which may extend to 3 years or with fine which may extend to Rs. 10,000/- or both. 13♦ Any person engaged in determination of the sex of the foetus or any person who owns a test/examination centre and contravenes any of the provisions of the Act or rules thereunder shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term not extending 3 years or with fine which may extend to Rs. 10,000/- or both. ♦ On subsequent conviction, the offender will be punishable with imprisonment extending to 5 years and with fine which may extend to Rs. 50,000/-. ♦ After carrying out the test of determining the sex of the foetus, if the medical practitioner or the compounder reveals the sex of the foetus, it is deemed as criminal conduct and they too can be booked under this Act. ♦ If the offence is made by a doctor/ medical practitioner, it may result in 14suspension of the registration and removal of his name from the register of the Council (State Medical Council) for a period of 5 years for the first offence and permanently for the subsequent offence. ♦ Advertisements on pre-natal sex determination are also unlawful and illegal. Any person or organisation involved in such advertisement shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term not extending 3 years or with fine which may extend to Rs. 10,000/-. M.T.P. Act, 1971 (Medical Termination of Pregnancy) ♦ Sex determination or medical termination of pregnancy after determination is an offence. However, medical termination of pregnancy is legal under certain circumstances. 15♦ These circumstances are in consonance with MTP Act, 1971 (Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971). Under this Act, medical termination of pregnancy can be carried out only within 12 weeks of pregnancy. Only under the following circumstances, medical termination of pregnancy may be carried out if :  the pregnancy is fatal for the mother.  conception is due to rape.  conception is due to failure of family planning techniques or  the unborn child has abnormalities/ deformities. ♦ Medical termination of pregnancy should be within 12 weeks of pregnancy. Under special circumstances, medical termination of pregnancy can be carried out up to 20 weeks of pregnancy on the 16advice of 2 doctors. Medical termination of pregnancy is not possible after the fifth month of pregnancy. What We Can Do ♦ We should not indulge in pre-natal sex determination in our families. ♦ We should also advise our relatives, friends and neighbours to abstain from pre-natal sex determination. ♦ If any women in the vicinity seem to be afraid or under pressure to carry out pre-natal sex determination, we should reach out to help her. ♦ Doctors should pledge that they will never indulge in the crime of female foeticide. ♦ If we notice any such kind of activity in our vicinity, then we should immediately inform the Health Department. 17♦ We should have discussions in the society to change our attitude towards the girl child. ♦ At village level gatherings/assemblies, we should take resolutions to save the girl child. ♦ We should spread awareness among all village folks to stop female foeticide. ♦ All young girls should be prepared with the mindset that they will not indulge in the crime of pre-natal sex determination in their future lives. ******* 18   \n",

The parents of Sepila work in these sites and Sepila migrated to the city along with them. As a result, she had to leave behind her small village and her school. Sepila had just begun her education in school. She was beginning to read and understand small short stories. Along with them, other families of the village and their children also migrated to the city. As the parents and other elders were engaged as workers in the construction sites, the children’s group spent their time in fun and frolic. For the first few days, the children were extremely happy since they were all living a carefree life. After the passage of 10 – 15 days, Sepila asked her mother, “Mom, when will you be granted leave? When will I return to school?” 1Her mother replied, “When the entire building will be completed, we will return to our village. Then you can go to your school.” Sepila went back to her friends and got involved with their fun and games. The next day, when all the children were playing, a lady approached them. The lady asked all the children, “Why don’t you all go to school?” The children replied, “Our school is in the village which is very far from here. We are only staying here for a few days.” 2The lady smiled and asked, “Okay, will you all not take me to your home?” The children replied, “Why not? Of course we all will take you to our homes.” The children then escorted the lady to their homes. The lady talked about all the children with their parents. She explained to them that they should send their children to the nearest school. Sepila’s mother said, “Madam, Sepila was actually asking the question as to when will she return to school. However we are strangers to 3this place. How can we enrol our children in a school in this place?” The lady replied that she was currently a teacher of the nearby school. She said, “Now, it is the responsibility of the government to provide education to all the children in the age group of 6 (six) to 14 (fourteen) years. To enforce this, the ‘Right to Education Act’ has been enacted. All of you can enrol your children in the nearest school. Sepila’s mother said, “We do not have any documents with us.” To this, the lady replied, 4“You do not need any documents to enrol your children in the school. For enrolling your children, you neither need to pay any fees nor incur any expenditure. Come to our school tomorrow itself.” Sepila was extremely delighted to hear all these. She said, “Wow mom! My school came here along with me!”. 5The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 The Government of India has enacted the “Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act” in the year 2009.

The entire responsibility of upbringing her two children have fallen on her shoulders. She did not even get a chance to mourn for the demise of her husband. Previously it was the onus of attending to her relatives and now it is the question of upbringing her children. Dealing with all these, the time has come when Hechila has to take a decision that she should get engaged in a job. After all, where will she be getting the money to pay for the house rent, education of her children and food and clothing? 1While these questions were running through her mind, an idea dawned in her mind. Hechila knows the work of appliqué very well. She started thinking that during this tough and trying time of hers, it will be her skill that will be of great help. Hechila expressed her thoughts to her neighbour, Aunt Khumla. After hearing what Hechila has been thinking, Khumla said that she will try to arrange for some job for her (Hechila) after consulting with her husband. After a few days, Khumla asked Hechila to display some of the samples of her work to the nearby boutique. If they like and accept her work, she may get a chance to work on their orders. There was a ray of hope for Hechila. She had with her wallets, mobile cover, purse, etc. which were previously made by her. She opened her old trunk and started searching for those items. While going through the items, she came 2across her wedding dress in the trunk which made her cry a lot. Then she consoled herself and looked at the positive side. After all, her children, the token of her husband are with her. She then took out the appliqué samples from the trunk and proceeded towards the kitchen for her chores. H e c h i l a q u i c k l y completed her daily c h o r e s early in the morning. Thereafter, she proceeded towards the address given by Aunt Khumla. She was filled with apprehensions and mixed thoughts. She began thinking, “What will I do if they don’t accept my works; I don’t 3know anything apart from it. If they refuse these works of mine, I will start preparing tiffins. However for preparing the tiffins, where will I get additional money to purchase foodgrains, vegetables and pulses? Additionally, I will also have to buy tiffin carriers.” When all these thoughts were running thick and fast through her mind, she reached the boutique. She stepped into the boutique with a lot of fear, nervousness and apprehension. It is for the first time in her life that she is seeing the interior of such a beautiful boutique. She was awestruck at the collection of the various mekhalas, ladies tops and shawls. Looking at all these she started thinking, “Will I ever be able to make such items?” At that instant, she was suddenly intercepted by the sight of a woman coming towards her. She was Sangtila, the owner of the boutique. Sangtila asked Hechila, “How may I help you?” 4Hechila narrated her sad story and sequence of events with tearful eyes to Sangtila and displayed the samples to her. The samples were really beautiful. Looking at them Sangtila said, “Don’t think that I am doing a favour for you. You have fineness in your hands. Don’t worry, I will provide a job for you.” Hearing this, Hechila quietly 5thanked God. She was in disbelief that her prayers were answered so soon. Sangtila handed over to Hechila a mekhala, design samples, beads, threads and many other such materials. She also gave her a deadline when Hechila is supposed to complete the work and bring it to the boutique. Thereafter, everyday in the afternoon, H e c h i l a started her work of appliqué. As a result, the o u t c o m e was such that, Hechila completed her work before the given date. Hechila was eagerly waiting for her first salary. On the said deadline, she reached the boutique and showed her work to Sangtila. Sangtila was quite happy at 6Hechila’s work and asked Chuba, an employee of the boutique, to pay her the requisite amount of money. This time Hechila took along a shawl with her. The bigger the work, the bigger is the money. This went on for quite a while. In the meanwhile, Hechila admitted her daughter in a school. Slowly she started saving some amount of money after meeting all her expenses. Appliqué was a hobby of Hechila. She was happy that her skill has helped her in the time of her need. There were many instances when Hechila collected her salary from Chuba when Sangtila was not around in the boutique. There were a number of times when Hechila felt that Chuba stared at her in an inappropriate manner, but she ignored his stares. Soon there were times when Chuba handed over her salary in such a way that his hands touched hers. Hechila felt 7uncomfortable at all these happenings but abstained from saying anything. She consoled herself by thinking that these are mere accidents. Chuba knew about the condition of Hechila’s family. He knew that she was a helpless lady. Now, Chuba started calling Hechila in the boutique when Sangtila was not around. There were many times when he stood extremely close to her or tried to obstruct her way by standing at the doorway when Hechila moved out of the boutique. Hechila had no other options since she had to draw her salary through Chuba only. Hechila started getting depressed. She started despising the actions of Chuba. At times, she cried and wept at home alone. At one instance, when Hechila visited the boutique with her works, only a few workers were present. Taking advantage of the situation, Chuba expressed his desire to 8Hechila to have physical relationship with her. Hechila was shocked at this indecent proposal of Chuba. She ran home without even taking her money. She was shivering with the fear that some kind of crime was about to take place. She turned pale. It was for the first time that such kind of statement was made to her. While Hechila was on her way to her home, she coincidently met her neighbour, Aunt Khumla. Hechila turned emotional when she saw Aunt Khumla. On being asked by Aunt Khumla the reason of Hechila being emotional, Hechila narrated the entire 9incident that she had faced. She had fear in her mind as to what will happen in the near future. The next time she goes to collect her dues, what will Chuba say and do? Being fed up of these, she wanted to leave the job. Aunt Khumla told her not to be scared about this matter. If she leaves this job what other alternative does she have? What guarantees her that there will be no people like Chuba in other jobs? Aunt Khumla further said that she came across an article in the newspaper that such kind of unwanted and unwarranted behaviours are punishable offences as per the law, which Chuba deserves. Both of them then decided that they will narrate the incident to Sangtila so that the other ladies in the boutique will be spared from the same harassment from Chuba. Sangtila’s husband held a high designation in the Department of Police and 10hence, she was aware of such laws. Chuba got scared at the warning given by Sangtila. He was deeply worried about his wife and children as to who will be looking after them if he will be put behind bars. He started begging for forgiveness to Sangtila and said, “Henceforth, I will not commit such an offence in the future”. Sangtila wanted to give Chuba a second chance, since this was the first time that he was found guilty of such offence. However, to make him realise the gravity of his offence, she wanted him to meet her husband the next day. Having no other alternative, Chuba agreed to do so. 11The next day, Chuba was presented before Sangtila’s husband. Her husband attended to the matter very seriously. He told Chuba that in today’s world, terrible and dreadful crime against women starts from such small incidents. The m a t t e r worsens by the day. T o d a y women have come out of their homes and started working. Men should try to understand their conditions. Men have no right to make friendship against their wishes. For a woman, her dignity is of the highest importance, which even men should try to protect. 12Sangtila warned Chuba, “This is your first offence, so I will give you a chance to correct and improve yourself. Henceforth, your behaviour towards Hechila should be a respectable one or else you will be behind the bars.” Chuba, with regretful tears in his eyes, asked for forgiveness from Sangtila and Hechila. All this while, Hechila had been listening to all these discussions. She was surprised that the government had introduced so many laws for preserving the dignity of a woman and she was not aware of any of it. Knowing all these, a new kind of strength kindled within herself. She is now confident that she, along with her children, can live a life of honour and dignity in this unknown world. Hechila bowed to God in reverence once again and thanked the Almighty for his never ending grace. ———— 13Provisions against Sexual Harassment ♦ The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, came into force on February 2013. ♦ This law is also applicable to women working at homes (maid-servants). ♦ As per the law, the accused should be punished within 90 days and failure to do so by the office will attract penalty. ♦ If harassment at workplace has not stopped or the accused are not punished, then the punishment will keep on becoming harsher.

C E R T I F I C A T E This is to certify that the Law Department, Govenment of Meghalaya has vetted the Legal Literacy Materials consisting of 11 booklets and 11 folders in English Language.

The school, and their teacher, Mr. Hopong’s house are made of tin while all the other houses in the village are thatch roofed. The Public Work Department (PWD), wanting to build a road through the edge of their village, made provisions for acquiring the required measurements for the development of the road. Of what land they use for the construction of the said road, they promised all the necessary compensation to the affected villagers. On the 22nd of March, there was a public announcement in the evening stating that the compensation money would be distributed the following morning and that everyone who was to receive it was to report 1to the teacher, Mr. Hopong’s house to collect their share. The next day, as announced, all the land owners assembled at Mr. Hopong’s house. Two persons accompanied the P.W.D. head and the Sub-Divisional Officer (SDO); the people in charge of handing out the money sat at a table and all who were to receive the compensation money were seated facing them. 2Standing up, the S.D.O said, “The land we are taking from you is unequal and varying in size. However, the difference is not too vast, and since calculating each and every person’s land is all too big a task in itself, we have taken an average on the compen-sation amount to be paid to each of you. We will be giving everyone here a sum of Rs. 20,000 for his land.” “Your names and the amount you are to receive have been written here and each of you will have to give his signature next to his name. If you are unable to write, your thumb print will be sufficient,” he continued. The people obliged and did as instructed, with every person receiving his share of the money. In Chungmoi, there was a person who was strictly against corruption. His name was, Mr. Awang. On learning about the method of the distribution of the compensation money, Mr. Awang had a hunch about it. He asked Mrs. Apoung who 3was one of the land owners who received the compensation about the matter. She (Mrs. Apoung) is a person who is very particular about things. Listening attentively to what Mrs. Apoung said, Mr. Awang adviced her to make an inquiry on the matter under Right To Information (RTI). Mrs. Apoung had never heard of the concept before. He told her the meaning and the workings of R.T.I. He explained to her that R.T.I (Right to Information), is a device which enabled citizens to have the necessary information on things done by the government to maintain transparency and curb corruption. He continued by telling her that 4whatever inquiry made, will be answered within a period of 30 days failure to which, the party under inquiry will be prosecuted. Nothing is kept secret from the public unless it is valuable information threatening National security. “Thank you. After hearing what you have said, I have a feeling that something is not right here. I will inform the others about it 5and we shall file an R.T.I inquiry with your help”, said Mrs. Apoung. Then the landowners of Chungmoi village went to the District Headquarter P.W.D Office and searched for the Public Information Officer (P.I.O). On finding him, they handed him the inquiry letter and the Rs. 10 fee. They were informed that it would take 30 days for them to receive the information. The appellate authority of the public authority shall dispose of the appeal within a period of thirty days or in exceptional cases within 45 days of the receipt of the appeal. After investigation, it was found out that the landowners got only half of the allotted money for their land compensation, and the money to be given each person also varied according to the size of land used for the construction site. Also, names of people who did not belong to the village were found 6written on the list which stated that they were paid the money. The amount sanctioned by the government was Rs. 5,00,000 but what the people of Chungmoi received was only Rs. 2,00,000 and that to the unknown names was Rs. 1,00,000. The missing Rs. 2,00,000 was not recorded. The government launched an investigation against the culprits of this misdemeanour. 7It was found that the P.W.D Minister pocketed Rs. 2,00,000. Their modus operandi was such that the minister called his subordinate officer and told him this, “For the Government work, Rs. 2,00,000 is required. Quickly send that money. The remaining Rs. 3,00,000, distributed as per your discretion.” Of the Rs. 5,00,000, the minister took Rs. 2,00,000, the land owners of Chungmoi received Rs. 2,00,000, and the remaining Rs. 1,00,000 was written off to the names of the people who were not residents of the village of Chungmoi. The S.D.O, their cashier and the Minister in charge where punished as per the law. All the money that they wrongfully took from the people, they were forced to repay the full amount and by the command of the court, all the people found guilty were put behind bars. 8After this, all the land owners of Chungmoi received the due amount which they were each allotted and each of them also upgraded from their thatch roof houses to houses with roofs made of tin. The widowed Mrs. Apoung received the largest amount of money. With that money, she constructed the biggest house in their village. ************* ********** ******* *** 9   \n",

Shillong, the 28th February, 2017. C E R T I F I C A T E This is to certify that the Law Department, Govenment of Meghalaya has vetted the Legal Literacy Materials consisting of 11 booklets and 11 folders in English Language. These material are found to be satisfactory and would be of immense use in disseminating legal awareness to the grassroots level in the State. Date: 28.02.2017 ( S.K. Sangma ) Under Secretary to the Govt. of Meghalaya, Law Department. ****The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 Shongmu was preparing her daughter Apoung for school. Apoung asked for money to pay her school fees. Shongmu went to her and asked him the required amount of money to pay the school fees. This enraged her husband. He started abusing and screaming at Shongmu and said, “Does money bloom in plants that I will pluck and bring to you? What great will we achieve by educating her so much? Teach her the daily 1household chores. They will be more useful to her. I don’t have extra money to waste. Go from here and start preparing my breakfast.” A couple of days later, Shongmu once again asked her husband some money to purchase some grocery items. To this, her husband replied, “You ask for money all the time. It seems you spend a lot of money. I remember that only a few days back, you took some money from me. Did you spend all of it? Your parents have not gifted me a big corpus of funds from which I can remit you money daily. God! In whose company have I fallen into?” Shongmu always had to rely on her husband for all her requirement, both small and big. Her husband always insulted her whenever she sought financial help. He abused her and harassed her mentally. He not only abused her but also her parents. 2One day, things went out of hand. Her husband was drunk when he returned home at night. Shongmu was setting the dinner table. Her husband became angry at the sight of the food and screamed at her, “What kind of food is this? I give you so much money to make purchases and yet you give me such kind of food.” 3With the mixture of anger and intoxication, he forcefully threw his dish from the table. The dish hit Shongmu and all her clothes were soiled with the food. To make matters worse, the dish hit her face and head. The impact was so great that she was injured and her head started to bleed. However, her husband was intoxicated; he did not notice what had happened. Instead he held her by her hair and started to physically abuse and manhandled her. He also threw her out of the house. 4Shongmu stood outside the house and pleaded with her husband to let her in. However, her husband did not let her in. Instead he said, “Go away from here. From today onwards you have no relation to this house.” Shongmu’s neighbour, Khumla noticed Shongmu in that condition and she took her to her home. She attended to her wounds and said, “How could you bear such atrocities? Are you going to live your entire life like this?” 5Shongmu replied, “Fate has this in store for me. I carry out all the household activities the whole day, but he treats me like his slave. My only duties are to prepare food for the family, washing clothes, sending the children to school and tend to all his needs.” Khumla said, “No, it is not like that. Yesterday, I went to the Anganwadi meeting. There one madam came. She said that a law has been enacted for women. That law is known as The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005. We will seek help under this law.” The next morning, Khumla took Shongmu to an official. The official is known as Protection Officer in all the places. Shongmu narrated all the past incidents and experiences through which she went through. The Protection Officer listened to her very carefully. The Protection Officer who was a lady said, “This law is made for women like you who are victim to such 6atrocities. As per this law, your husband will be called and we will make him understand. If he does not conform to what we say, then you can file a case against him. We will help you in every possible ways.” The lady Protection Officer handed over a form to Shongmu which is known as D.I.R. (Domestic Incident Report). This form contains the description of the types of 7violence against women. The victimised women should describe the type of violence that has taken place against her. In case the victimised woman is not educated, then the Protection Officer himself/herself reads the form to her so that she can describe the type of violence that she has undergone through. By this process the D.I.R. Form of Shongmu was filled and her husband was called for reconciliation. This law is designed to make homes rather than breaking homes. The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 The Protection of Women from Domestic Act, 2005 has been introduced to protect the rights of women who are victims of family violence. 8This is a Civil Law for more effective protection of the rights of women (wives, mothers, sisters, daughters, single women etc.) who are victims of violence of any kind occurring within the family and for matters connected herewith or incidental thereto which includes physical abuse, mental abuse, sexual abuse, verbal and emotional abuse and economic abuse.

What happened uncle?” “He has been telling the whole village that the government will now provide foodgrains to all the poor at affordable prices.” 1“Oh, really! Has he been saying all these? Then surely he has gone out of his mind. Can this really happen?” asked Takam. “Come on! Be happy that the government is providing us food at affordable rates. Where is the problem there?” enquired Sangtila. “Then let’s go and ask Prerak Awang of Adult Education Centre” replied uncle. After reaching the Adult Education Centre, Takam greeted Awang, “Hello 2brother Awang”. Awang greeted and said, “Hello. Why is it that all of you have come together to meet me today? “Brother Awang, we all have come here to enquire about the scheme related to foodgrains which the government has announced.” “Alright. Please take your seats and I shall explain everything about it to all of you. 3The government has introduced Food Security Scheme recently. This scheme has been introduced with the aim of providing nutritional and quality food to poor people so that they can live a healthy life.” Thereafter Takam asked, “What are the provisions of this scheme?” Awang replied, “Through this scheme, people will receive rice, wheat and coarse foodgrains at affordable and reasonable rates.” 4Sangtila then questioned Awang, “Are there any benefits for women in this scheme?” Awang nodded and answered, “Yes, women will also be benefited through this scheme. Pregnant and lactating women will receive special nutritional support. Even women who are the head of the family shall receive special privilege. As per the scheme, women will be considered to be the head of the family and the ration card will be issued in their names.” “Alright, where can we obtain this card from?” Takam asked. At this, Awang replied, “This card can be obtained from the Village Council or from the office of the Food Department.” “Where will the foodgrains be available?” Uncle questioned. 5Awang said, “The foodgrains will be available through Government Fair Price Shops.” “What will be the quantity of foodgrains that we all will be receiving?” Menang wondered. Awang then replied to her question, “Each family shall receive 35 kilograms of foodgrains.” After knowing about the scheme, uncle was quite happy and contented and said, “Thank you Awang, for providing us these vital and valuable information.

He had two acres of agricultural land beside the street, near the river. Near Likokba’s land, there was a land of Imlong, an affluent man of the village, which was located towards the back side of Likokba’s land. Likokba was married to Menang. He was blessed with a son named Awang and a 1daughter named Khumla. They all dwelled in a small hut erected on his agricultural land. Likokba’s daughter was about to get married for which he was in need of money. To seek financial help, he went to Imlong. He asked Imlong to lend him some money as a loan. Imlong agreed to provide the loan to Likokba at once. However, Imlong’s intentions were not right. He always wanted to grab Likokba’s land by any means so that his land will be connected with the street that runs beside Likokba’s land. Imlong considered this as a golden opportunity for him. He said to Likokba, “Likokba, I will provide you money, but you have to carry out the formalities in the government office.” Khumla’s marriage was in the next month and Likokba was in dire need of money. As Likokba was not educated, he believed Imlong and agreed to do what Imlong had said. 2Imlong lent the money to Likokba at the government office. He prepared some document and took Likokba’s thumb impression on the documents. Likokba’s daughter Khumla was married to Hopong. During that year, there was a good harvest of wheat in Likokba’s field. He sold his wheat in the wholesale market for farmer’s agricultural produce. The wheat was sold at good rate. Since Likokba had surplus money, he, along with his brother Mandok, went to Imlong to pay off the loan amount along with the interest. 3Likokba asked Imlong for the documents wherein he had put his thumb impression while taking the money. Imlong, deffered the matter and gave the excuse that he will have to search for the documents. He assured Likokba that he will return him the documents after finding them. As Likokba and Mandok were innocent and illiterate farmers, they believed Imlong and the matter was left there itself. Monsoon was soon approaching and time has come to till the soil once again. Likokba went to plough his field and sow the seeds for the upcoming season. When Likokba entered his field, he saw the servants of Imlong were standing on his field. When the servants saw Likokba, they did not allow Likokba to plough his field and chased him away from his land. Imlong’s servants then started sowing the seeds with the help of a tractor that belonged to 4Imlong. Likokba was perplexed and could not understand what was going on. He then approached Imlong to enquire about the matter. Likokba asked Imlong, “You have not returned me the documents where I put my thumb impression on, even though I had repaid the money that I borrowed from you. Now what are your servants doing in my land? Why are they sowing seeds in my land with your tractor?” Imlong replied in anger, “Likokba, you have sold your land to me. You are no longer 5the owner of the land. If you ever set foot on my land, I will kill you.” Likokba got scared at the threat of Imlong. He started crying and pleaded for mercy. With folded hands, Likokba said, “Soon after harvesting my crops and selling them, I had returned the money that I owed to you in front of Mandok as a witness. However, you had not returned the documents of the loan. Moreover, you have even tried to deviate from the matter. For God’s sake, please don’t be dishonest.” On hearing this Imlong furiously said, “Are you going to fight with me? Someone throw him out of my house.” Poor Likokba had no other option. He wept and cried and came back to his home. On his way, Likokba met the Village Council Chairman. On seeing Likokba crying, he enquired as to what the matter was. 6Likokba narrated the entire incident to the Village Council Chairman with tearful eyes. The Village Council Chairman listened to him very carefully. He regained Likokba’s composure and instilled courage in Likokba and said, “You need not worry. Have courage. The government has provided special facilities and rights to the people belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. People belonging to Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes will receive justice, free of cost, through special courts. You will get back your land and Imlong will be put behind bars.” 7The Village Council Chairman took Likokba to the police station where Likokba narrated the entire story. The policeman, after hearing from Likokba as to how his land has been snatched, said, “Wrongfully dispossessing a member of a Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe from his land by any person will be considered as an offence. Preparing fraud documents is a legal crime which leads to severe penalty or imprisonment. You lodge an FIR. Imlong will be punished for his misdoings.” The policeman further told Likokba, “The trial of your case will be in a special court. You don’t have to pay the legal charges and the lawyer’s fees. The Government of India has provided these facilities to the people belonging to Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes so that they can live their life with honour and dignity. As per this law, Imlong will not be granted bail. You will receive your farm land back. We will protect your land.” 8in his land and soon the seeds bloomed into abundant greenery. Likokba and his family were delighted to see the abundant crop in their field. They started living a normal and happy life. The police official who helped Likokba often comes and inquires about his daily state of affairs. He too was pleased that Likokba is now leading a normal life. 10The Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 People belonging to the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes have the right of equality in the society.

C E R T I F I C A T E This is to certify that the Law Department, Govenment of Meghalaya has vetted the Legal Literacy Materials consisting of 11 booklets and 11 folders in English Language.

Sangma ) Under Secretary to the Govt. of Meghalaya, Law Department. ****(Pongtang Gets Justice) Pongtang was a labourer in Noksen Village. His family comprised of his wife Sepila, daughter Shongmu and son Mandok. Pongtang’s aged father and mother also lived with him. Pongtang and Sepila used to work in farms to earn their family’s livelihood. A farmer named Hemyen lived in Pongtang’s neighbourhood. He had five acres of land in the village. He used to call Pongtang and Sepila for tending the crops. However, Pongtang and Sepila never went to work in Hemyen’s farm because Hemyen always looked at Sepila in an obscene and lewd manner, which made Sepila uncomfortable. Once, Pongtang and Sepila went to Hemyen’s farm to sow some seeds. While working, Hemyen sent Pongtang to fetch the plough from Hemyen’s house. At 1that moment Hemyen started teasing and taunting Sepila. From that i n c i d e n t o n w a r d s , Pongtang and Sepila stopped going to Hemyen’s farm for any kind of work. Due to this reason, Hemyen wanted to seek vengeance on them. One day, a rich man’s jewels were stolen in the village. The rich man lodged an FIR in the Police Station regarding the theft, after which the police started investigating the matter in the village. 2Hemyen wanted to take advantage of this situation. He planned to falsely accuse Pongtang of this theft so that when Pongtang is put behind bars, Sepila will approach him to seek help since the Sub-Divisional lawyer, Chaushak often visits Hemyen. During the course of their investigation when the police approached Hemyen, Hemyen said, “It is Pongtang who has stolen the jewels.” The police went to Pongtang’s House and found some of the stolen jewels in front of his house. The police confiscated the jewels and prepared a confiscation report. The police became suspicious of Pongtang. They searched the entire house of Pongtang but did not find anything. However, they arrested Pongtang. Following the arrest, Sepila and his aged parents became scared and anxious. Sepila said, “Who will save my husband from being imprisoned? We neither 3have money to spend nor to pay the fees of any lawyer.” Hearing the words of Sepila, her son Imlong said, “Mother, you need not worry. I have seen a board near the bus stand regarding free legal assistance and consultancy. There, two lawyers were talking to the Village Council Chairman. They were saying that the government has made provisions to provide justice to the poor 4villagers. Let us go to that office and try to free our father.” Hearing this, Sepila’s fear receded a bit. She went to the Free Legal Assistance and Consultancy Centre and met the lawyer. The next day, the police presented Pongtang in the court before the judge. The judge started interrogating Pongtang. Pongtang pleaded that he is innocent and that the theft was not carried out by him. He further said that he is falsely accused of the theft and the police forcefully arrested him. He and his family earn their livelihood by hard work and not by 5wrong means. He said that he has not stolen anything and the stolen items are not in his possession. The judge asked Pongtang, “Do you have a lawyer to fight for your case and provide you justice?” Pongtang replied, “We are poor and illiterate. How can we fight a case? We don’t have any money to pay for a lawyer. When will you set me free from the prison? I have to go for my daily work to run my family. The judge carefully listened to his words and then he said, “We will provide you a lawyer at the expense of the government.” The lawyer from the Free Legal Assistance and Consultancy Centre appeared before the judge. His wife Sepila and his son Mandok were also present with the lawyer. 6The lawyer immediately presented the papers for Pongtang’s bail. He told all the truth about the case to the judge and asked the judge to release him on bail. The judge approved the bail plea of Pongtang. 7Since the police filed a case against Pongtang, the lawyer from the Free Legal Assistance and Consultancy Centre fought for Pongtang. He finally argued that Pongtang is innocent. The stolen items were not recovered from him and the police also failed to present any witness or proof against Pongtang. Considering all the facts, proofs and witnesses of the case and the arguments of the lawyers, the judge passed the judgement that there is no proof against Pongtang and he should be set free.

C E R T I F I C A T E This is to certify that the Law Department, Govenment of Meghalaya has vetted the Legal Literacy Materials consisting of 11 booklets and 11 folders in English Language. These material are found to be satisfactory and would be of immense use in disseminating legal awareness to the grassroots level in the State. Date: 28.02.2017 ( S.K. Sangma ) Under Secretary to the Govt. of Meghalaya, Law Department. ****(Our Jungle – Our Trust) The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 and Rules 2008 Today a lot of people have been moving around in the village of Sanglao. Everyone is going towards the Village Council. People are expecting Chila, a female lawyer from 1the city. The Chairman of the Village Council is a gentleman by the name of Showba. He has been telling the people that the lawyer will be discussing about the Law of Forest Rights. This law has been enacted to protect the rights of the tribal people who dwell in forests. This law also covers the rights of other traditional forest dwellers. While Showba, the Chairman of the Village Council, has been talking about all these to the villagers, the lawyer, Chila arrived at the gathering of the village council. Everybody welcomed her with respect. Thereafter, Chila began her talk. She said, “All of you who have gathered here are Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Dwellers who have been dwelling in forests for centuries together. You all have always trusted and contibuted greatly towards the protection of the forests. The forest is your home and if your home does not get the 2appropriate rights, it will be a big injustice done to you all.” She continued, “Among you all were those tribes who had been compelled to forego their homes in the name of development and had to settle in some other place. Insecurity related to land has been a problem which has been continuing for a long time. To curb this menace, Forest Rights Act, 2006 and Rules 2008 have been framed.” All the forest dwellers present at 3the gathering were listening very carefully to Chila. Hopong said: “Madam Lawyer, what benefit will we get from this law?” Chila replied: “This is a valid question. In this Forest Rights Act, the Scheduled Tribes and other forest dwellers have been given some legal rights:  All tribal dwellers who have been residing in the forest earlier than 2005, shall receive land rights documents. 4 All other traditional forest dwellers who have been residing in the forest for three generations (seventy five years) will also receive land rights documents.  Right of ownership shall also be given for village, habitat and community forest land.” Imlong asked – “Are lands under community rights also included under this Law?” Chila replies – “Yes, rights of land under community rights will be given to forests dwellers as per rules of the State.  Forest rights will also be given to forest dwelling Schedules Tribes and other traditional forest dwellers on other community rights of uses or entitlements such as fish and other products of water bodies.  The forest dwelling Schedules Tribes and other traditional forest dwellers shall have 5the right of access to collect, use and dispose of minor forest produce such as bamboo, brush wood, stumps, cane, cocoons, honey, wax, lac, or leaves, medicinal plants and herbs, roots, tubers, stones, chips and the like.  Forest dwelling Scheduled Tribes and other traditional forest dwellers shall have the rights to transport the minor forest produce from the forest to villages and market through head loading, bicycle or hand cart.  No licences shall be issued on water bodies without the permission of the community.” Menang asked – “Can forest land be utilised for any other purpose?” Chila replied – “The Village Council has the right for diversion of forest land for the facilities like schools; dispensaries or hospital; anganwadis; fair price shops; 6tanks and other minor water bodies; electric lines, drinking water supply and water pipelines; roads; skill upgradation or vocational training centres; community centres. However, this should involve felling of trees not exceeding 75 trees.” Figure 1 7Lithrongla was listening quietly up till now. She also asked a question, “Who will have the right over the habitat of the tribal forest dwellers?” Chila replied – “The tribal forest dwellers will get the right of ownership over their habitat. They will have the rights of settlement and conversion of all forest villagers, old habitation, villages which are 8not surveyed and other villages in forests whether recorded, notified or not into revenue villages.” In today’s meeting, there are a lot of tribal people who were forcefully removed from their lands. Among them was Takam. He gathered courage and asked, ‘Can the tribal people who were displaced by the Forest Department come back and resettle in their own habitat?” Chila could understand the pain of Takam. She said, “If the tribal people are displaced before 13th December, 2005 by the Forest Department and if they have not been given compensation and they have not found a place to dwell, then they can resettle in their previous dwelling place. If the State plans to undertake certain developmental projects and as a consequence they need to acquire forest lands, the developmental project should kick 9start in the acquired forest land within five years of acquirement.

Both of them studied together and grew up together. One day Chila was engaged to get married. On hearing this news, Khandang had mixed feelings. She was happy as well as sad. She was happy because her friend is going to be settled and sad because both of them have to part from each other owing to their upcoming new lives. 1Within a few days Chila got married. Whenever Chila visited her maternal home, both Chila and Khandang used to talk for hours. Within their talks, Chila described her new family to Khandang while Khandang described the recent happenings in the village, the crops in the field and the threshing place. A year later, Chila came to her maternal home for maternal care. This time she was going to stay for a longer duration. Khandang was delighted at this. She often came to visit Chila. Chila was soon blessed with a beautiful daughter. However, her in-laws seemed a bit unhappy. On the other side, Khandang was extremely happy. To celebrate her happiness, Khandang prepared some 2laddoos (sweets) and took them to the hospital and distributed them to everyone. Looking at this, Khandang’s mother told Chila, “Chila, without you Khandang becomes very depressed but whenever you are by her side she gleams with happiness. Why don’t you look for a suitable groom for her and take her to your village? Thereafter, both of you can always be together.” 3Fate took such a turn that Khandang too got married to a person from the same village as that of Chila. Both of them were extremely happy. However, happiness was not there for long. There were a lot of restrictions in the house of the in-laws of Khandang. She was not allowed to meet anyone or go out of the house. Khandang often wondered as to when she will be able to meet Chila. 4One day both Chila and Khandang met each other in the Church. There, both of them decided that they will meet each other in the Church every Sunday evening. Both of them, then, eagerly waited for Sunday and when they met at the Church, they talked on a variety of topics. One Sunday evening, when both of them met in the Church, both of them looked sad. Unlike the other days, both of them did not look happy. Both of them sat at the steps of the Church and Chila told Khandang, “Khandang, I have something to tell you.” “Something is also troubling me too, Chila” said Khandang. “Troubling you? What is troubling you?” asked Chila. Khandang said, “First you. Let me know what you want to tell.” 5Chila replied, “No, first you. I would like to solve your problem first. Tell me what is troubling you?” Khandang then replied, “This ‘you first’, ‘you first’ will finally lead us to the time when we will be leaving for our homes. Alright let me tell you what is troubling me.” She continued, “Chila, about 4-5 days before I was very happy, when I learnt that I am going to become a mother. Every night I dreamt about the child and now my mother- in-law is about to take me to the doctor for a sex- determination test. My mother-in-law says that the first child should be a boy. I know that carrying out a sex-determination test is an offence. Do you remember that lady doctor who told us in school that determining the sex of the foetus is an offence? But how will I say this to my in- laws? What shall I do? Tell me.” 6On hearing this, Chila held her head and said, “My God! This thing was also running through my head. This was what I was going to say. Do you remember that everyone was displeased when a daughter was born to me? Everyone was chiding me and this time everyone in my family is asking me to go for a sex-determination test. I am really scared. If this time also I give birth to a daughter, then....? Are we going to commit this offence? Madam Doctor said that this is a crime. We will become criminals, Khandang.” Khandang showed a lot of conviction and said out rightly, “No Chila, whatever may be, we are not going to do anything wrong. The lady doctor from the city comes on Mondays only. Our family members will be taking us to her on that day. Think of something as to how can we be saved from this sin.” 7Both of them silently thought about this matter. Then Chila whispered into Khandang’s ears, “Have courage. We are two of us here.” Thereafter, both of them left for their own respective homes. On Monday, Chila’s mother -in-law took her to the hospital. While Chila was sitting on the bench and waiting for her turn, she was also waiting for Khandang’s arrival. A few moments later, Khandang arrived with her mother-in-law. The lady doctor also arrived at the hospital after sometime. Both Chila and Khandang were surprised to learn that the lady doctor is the same doctor who used to visit their school. They held each others’ hand and saw a ray of hope. Both of their fears vanished and they both gave a smile of relief. During the check up, Khandang’s mother-in-law was present with her. So, she 8was unable to say anything. However, when Chila got the chance, she told the doctor what was in her mind. The doctor consoled her and gestured to her to remain quiet. After a while, Chila’s mother-in-law slowly requested the doctor to carry out the sex- determination test. However, the doctor flatly refused to do so. The doctor also called in Khandang’s mother-in-law. Then she started explaining to both of them, “It is God 9who decides whether the child will be a boy or a girl. Pre-natal sex-determination is a punishable offence. Determination of sex of the foetus will result in punishment for you as well as for me....” In the meanwhile, when the doctor was explaining to both the mothers-in-law inside the chamber, the two close friends hugged each other outside with tears of joy. 10Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (Prohibition of Sex Selection) Act, 1994, amended 2003. A few years back, the technology for pre- natal sex determination was developed. This technology is useful in detecting and curing the physical and mental defects of the child in the womb. Moreover, with this technology other diseases of the foetus can be detected and the diseases can be cured. However, this technology has been misutilised. People have been using this technology to determine the sex/gender of the foetus. When people came to know that the foetus was that of a girl, they would go for forced abortion. As a result, the number of female foeticide cases began to rise. Due to this, the ratio of females to males (sex ratio) began to fall in a rapid pace. To curb 11with the dwindling sex ratio and misutilisation of the technology, an Act was enacted. The Act is known as The Pre- Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (Prohibition of Sex Selection) Act, 1994, as amended in 2003. As per the provisions of this Act, any laboratory, testing/examination centre or clinic is restricted from determining the sex of the foetus. According to this Act, determination of the sex of the foetus is allowed only in certain special conditions. Pre-Natal Diagnostic Tests are considered legal only in the following conditions: ♦ The child in the womb has chromosomal irregularity/abnormality. ♦ The pregnant woman has undergone two or more spontaneous abortions. 12♦ The age of the pregnant woman is above 35 years. ♦ The pregnant woman had been exposed to potentially teratogenic agents such as drugs, radiation, infection or chemicals, which may result in physical deformities or mental retardation of the child. ♦ The pregnant woman or her spouse has a family history of mental retardation or physical deformities such as, spasticity or any other genetic disease Penalties as per the Act ♦ If any person goes for sex determination test wilfully or under pressure, then he or she will be deemed as guilty. The penalties for the offence is imprisonment for a term which may extend to 3 years or with fine which may extend to Rs. 10,000/- or both. 13♦ Any person engaged in determination of the sex of the foetus or any person who owns a test/examination centre and contravenes any of the provisions of the Act or rules thereunder shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term not extending 3 years or with fine which may extend to Rs. 10,000/- or both. ♦ On subsequent conviction, the offender will be punishable with imprisonment extending to 5 years and with fine which may extend to Rs. 50,000/-. ♦ After carrying out the test of determining the sex of the foetus, if the medical practitioner or the compounder reveals the sex of the foetus, it is deemed as criminal conduct and they too can be booked under this Act. ♦ If the offence is made by a doctor/ medical practitioner, it may result in 14suspension of the registration and removal of his name from the register of the Council (State Medical Council) for a period of 5 years for the first offence and permanently for the subsequent offence. ♦ Advertisements on pre-natal sex determination are also unlawful and illegal. Any person or organisation involved in such advertisement shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term not extending 3 years or with fine which may extend to Rs. 10,000/-. M.T.P. Act, 1971 (Medical Termination of Pregnancy) ♦ Sex determination or medical termination of pregnancy after determination is an offence. However, medical termination of pregnancy is legal under certain circumstances. 15♦ These circumstances are in consonance with MTP Act, 1971 (Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971). Under this Act, medical termination of pregnancy can be carried out only within 12 weeks of pregnancy. Only under the following circumstances, medical termination of pregnancy may be carried out if :  the pregnancy is fatal for the mother.  conception is due to rape.  conception is due to failure of family planning techniques or  the unborn child has abnormalities/ deformities. ♦ Medical termination of pregnancy should be within 12 weeks of pregnancy. Under special circumstances, medical termination of pregnancy can be carried out up to 20 weeks of pregnancy on the 16advice of 2 doctors. Medical termination of pregnancy is not possible after the fifth month of pregnancy. What We Can Do ♦ We should not indulge in pre-natal sex determination in our families. ♦ We should also advise our relatives, friends and neighbours to abstain from pre-natal sex determination. ♦ If any women in the vicinity seem to be afraid or under pressure to carry out pre-natal sex determination, we should reach out to help her. ♦ Doctors should pledge that they will never indulge in the crime of female foeticide. ♦ If we notice any such kind of activity in our vicinity, then we should immediately inform the Health Department. 17♦ We should have discussions in the society to change our attitude towards the girl child. ♦ At village level gatherings/assemblies, we should take resolutions to save the girl child. ♦ We should spread awareness among all village folks to stop female foeticide. ♦ All young girls should be prepared with the mindset that they will not indulge in the crime of pre-natal sex determination in their future lives. ******* 18   \n",

The parents of Sepila work in these sites and Sepila migrated to the city along with them. As a result, she had to leave behind her small village and her school. Sepila had just begun her education in school. She was beginning to read and understand small short stories. Along with them, other families of the village and their children also migrated to the city. As the parents and other elders were engaged as workers in the construction sites, the children’s group spent their time in fun and frolic. For the first few days, the children were extremely happy since they were all living a carefree life. After the passage of 10 – 15 days, Sepila asked her mother, “Mom, when will you be granted leave? When will I return to school?” 1Her mother replied, “When the entire building will be completed, we will return to our village. Then you can go to your school.” Sepila went back to her friends and got involved with their fun and games. The next day, when all the children were playing, a lady approached them. The lady asked all the children, “Why don’t you all go to school?” The children replied, “Our school is in the village which is very far from here. We are only staying here for a few days.” 2The lady smiled and asked, “Okay, will you all not take me to your home?” The children replied, “Why not? Of course we all will take you to our homes.” The children then escorted the lady to their homes. The lady talked about all the children with their parents. She explained to them that they should send their children to the nearest school. Sepila’s mother said, “Madam, Sepila was actually asking the question as to when will she return to school. However we are strangers to 3this place. How can we enrol our children in a school in this place?” The lady replied that she was currently a teacher of the nearby school. She said, “Now, it is the responsibility of the government to provide education to all the children in the age group of 6 (six) to 14 (fourteen) years. To enforce this, the ‘Right to Education Act’ has been enacted. All of you can enrol your children in the nearest school. Sepila’s mother said, “We do not have any documents with us.” To this, the lady replied, 4“You do not need any documents to enrol your children in the school. For enrolling your children, you neither need to pay any fees nor incur any expenditure. Come to our school tomorrow itself.” Sepila was extremely delighted to hear all these. She said, “Wow mom! My school came here along with me!”. 5The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 The Government of India has enacted the “Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act” in the year 2009.

Sangma ) Under Secretary to the Govt. of Meghalaya, Law Department. ****Question of Dignity It has been only the sixth year of Hechila’s marriage and she has been widowed. The entire responsibility of upbringing her two children have fallen on her shoulders. She did not even get a chance to mourn for the demise of her husband. Previously it was the onus of attending to her relatives and now it is the question of upbringing her children. Dealing with all these, the time has come when Hechila has to take a decision that she should get engaged in a job. After all, where will she be getting the money to pay for the house rent, education of her children and food and clothing? 1While these questions were running through her mind, an idea dawned in her mind. Hechila knows the work of appliqué very well. She started thinking that during this tough and trying time of hers, it will be her skill that will be of great help. Hechila expressed her thoughts to her neighbour, Aunt Khumla. After hearing what Hechila has been thinking, Khumla said that she will try to arrange for some job for her (Hechila) after consulting with her husband. After a few days, Khumla asked Hechila to display some of the samples of her work to the nearby boutique. If they like and accept her work, she may get a chance to work on their orders. There was a ray of hope for Hechila. She had with her wallets, mobile cover, purse, etc. which were previously made by her. She opened her old trunk and started searching for those items. While going through the items, she came 2across her wedding dress in the trunk which made her cry a lot. Then she consoled herself and looked at the positive side. After all, her children, the token of her husband are with her. She then took out the appliqué samples from the trunk and proceeded towards the kitchen for her chores. H e c h i l a q u i c k l y completed her daily c h o r e s early in the morning. Thereafter, she proceeded towards the address given by Aunt Khumla. She was filled with apprehensions and mixed thoughts. She began thinking, “What will I do if they don’t accept my works; I don’t 3know anything apart from it. If they refuse these works of mine, I will start preparing tiffins. However for preparing the tiffins, where will I get additional money to purchase foodgrains, vegetables and pulses? Additionally, I will also have to buy tiffin carriers.” When all these thoughts were running thick and fast through her mind, she reached the boutique. She stepped into the boutique with a lot of fear, nervousness and apprehension. It is for the first time in her life that she is seeing the interior of such a beautiful boutique. She was awestruck at the collection of the various mekhalas, ladies tops and shawls. Looking at all these she started thinking, “Will I ever be able to make such items?” At that instant, she was suddenly intercepted by the sight of a woman coming towards her. She was Sangtila, the owner of the boutique. Sangtila asked Hechila, “How may I help you?” 4Hechila narrated her sad story and sequence of events with tearful eyes to Sangtila and displayed the samples to her. The samples were really beautiful. Looking at them Sangtila said, “Don’t think that I am doing a favour for you. You have fineness in your hands. Don’t worry, I will provide a job for you.” Hearing this, Hechila quietly 5thanked God. She was in disbelief that her prayers were answered so soon. Sangtila handed over to Hechila a mekhala, design samples, beads, threads and many other such materials. She also gave her a deadline when Hechila is supposed to complete the work and bring it to the boutique. Thereafter, everyday in the afternoon, H e c h i l a started her work of appliqué. As a result, the o u t c o m e was such that, Hechila completed her work before the given date. Hechila was eagerly waiting for her first salary. On the said deadline, she reached the boutique and showed her work to Sangtila. Sangtila was quite happy at 6Hechila’s work and asked Chuba, an employee of the boutique, to pay her the requisite amount of money. This time Hechila took along a shawl with her. The bigger the work, the bigger is the money. This went on for quite a while. In the meanwhile, Hechila admitted her daughter in a school. Slowly she started saving some amount of money after meeting all her expenses. Appliqué was a hobby of Hechila. She was happy that her skill has helped her in the time of her need. There were many instances when Hechila collected her salary from Chuba when Sangtila was not around in the boutique. There were a number of times when Hechila felt that Chuba stared at her in an inappropriate manner, but she ignored his stares. Soon there were times when Chuba handed over her salary in such a way that his hands touched hers. Hechila felt 7uncomfortable at all these happenings but abstained from saying anything. She consoled herself by thinking that these are mere accidents. Chuba knew about the condition of Hechila’s family. He knew that she was a helpless lady. Now, Chuba started calling Hechila in the boutique when Sangtila was not around. There were many times when he stood extremely close to her or tried to obstruct her way by standing at the doorway when Hechila moved out of the boutique. Hechila had no other options since she had to draw her salary through Chuba only. Hechila started getting depressed. She started despising the actions of Chuba. At times, she cried and wept at home alone. At one instance, when Hechila visited the boutique with her works, only a few workers were present. Taking advantage of the situation, Chuba expressed his desire to 8Hechila to have physical relationship with her. Hechila was shocked at this indecent proposal of Chuba. She ran home without even taking her money. She was shivering with the fear that some kind of crime was about to take place. She turned pale. It was for the first time that such kind of statement was made to her. While Hechila was on her way to her home, she coincidently met her neighbour, Aunt Khumla. Hechila turned emotional when she saw Aunt Khumla. On being asked by Aunt Khumla the reason of Hechila being emotional, Hechila narrated the entire 9incident that she had faced. She had fear in her mind as to what will happen in the near future. The next time she goes to collect her dues, what will Chuba say and do? Being fed up of these, she wanted to leave the job. Aunt Khumla told her not to be scared about this matter. If she leaves this job what other alternative does she have? What guarantees her that there will be no people like Chuba in other jobs? Aunt Khumla further said that she came across an article in the newspaper that such kind of unwanted and unwarranted behaviours are punishable offences as per the law, which Chuba deserves. Both of them then decided that they will narrate the incident to Sangtila so that the other ladies in the boutique will be spared from the same harassment from Chuba. Sangtila’s husband held a high designation in the Department of Police and 10hence, she was aware of such laws. Chuba got scared at the warning given by Sangtila. He was deeply worried about his wife and children as to who will be looking after them if he will be put behind bars. He started begging for forgiveness to Sangtila and said, “Henceforth, I will not commit such an offence in the future”. Sangtila wanted to give Chuba a second chance, since this was the first time that he was found guilty of such offence. However, to make him realise the gravity of his offence, she wanted him to meet her husband the next day. Having no other alternative, Chuba agreed to do so. 11The next day, Chuba was presented before Sangtila’s husband. Her husband attended to the matter very seriously. He told Chuba that in today’s world, terrible and dreadful crime against women starts from such small incidents. The m a t t e r worsens by the day. T o d a y women have come out of their homes and started working. Men should try to understand their conditions. Men have no right to make friendship against their wishes. For a woman, her dignity is of the highest importance, which even men should try to protect. 12Sangtila warned Chuba, “This is your first offence, so I will give you a chance to correct and improve yourself. Henceforth, your behaviour towards Hechila should be a respectable one or else you will be behind the bars.” Chuba, with regretful tears in his eyes, asked for forgiveness from Sangtila and Hechila. All this while, Hechila had been listening to all these discussions. She was surprised that the government had introduced so many laws for preserving the dignity of a woman and she was not aware of any of it. Knowing all these, a new kind of strength kindled within herself. She is now confident that she, along with her children, can live a life of honour and dignity in this unknown world. Hechila bowed to God in reverence once again and thanked the Almighty for his never ending grace. ———— 13Provisions against Sexual Harassment ♦ The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, came into force on February 2013. ♦ This law is also applicable to women working at homes (maid-servants). ♦ As per the law, the accused should be punished within 90 days and failure to do so by the office will attract penalty. ♦ If harassment at workplace has not stopped or the accused are not punished, then the punishment will keep on becoming harsher. It may also happen that the office may be shut down. ♦ The accused shall be penalised up to `50,000. 14♦ Touching/groping, displaying of ob- scene pictures, using obscene and lewd languages, demanding or requesting for physical relationships are included in sexual harassment. Any unwanted and unwarranted acts or behaviour are also included in sexual harassment. ♦ It is important to notify in the workplace that harassment of women is a punishable offence. ♦ It is important to constitute a committee in all workplaces where women can complain about any act of sexual harassment. ———— 15   \n",

GOVERNMENT OF MEGHALAYA LAW (B) DEPARTMENT ****** No.LJ(B). 114/2002/Pt/125 Dated Shillong, the 28th February, 2017. C E R T I F I C A T E This is to certify that the Law Department, Govenment of Meghalaya has vetted the Legal Literacy Materials consisting of 11 booklets and 11 folders in English Language. These material are found to be satisfactory and would be of immense use in disseminating legal awareness to the grassroots level in the State. Date: 28.02.2017 ( S.K. Sangma ) Under Secretary to the Govt. of Meghalaya, Law Department. ****STORY ON RIGHT TO INFORMATION The village of Chungmoi is a small one; with roughly 50 houses and one primary school. The school, and their teacher, Mr. Hopong’s house are made of tin while all the other houses in the village are thatch roofed. The Public Work Department (PWD), wanting to build a road through the edge of their village, made provisions for acquiring the required measurements for the development of the road. Of what land they use for the construction of the said road, they promised all the necessary compensation to the affected villagers. On the 22nd of March, there was a public announcement in the evening stating that the compensation money would be distributed the following morning and that everyone who was to receive it was to report 1to the teacher, Mr. Hopong’s house to collect their share. The next day, as announced, all the land owners assembled at Mr. Hopong’s house. Two persons accompanied the P.W.D. head and the Sub-Divisional Officer (SDO); the people in charge of handing out the money sat at a table and all who were to receive the compensation money were seated facing them. 2Standing up, the S.D.O said, “The land we are taking from you is unequal and varying in size. However, the difference is not too vast, and since calculating each and every person’s land is all too big a task in itself, we have taken an average on the compen-sation amount to be paid to each of you. We will be giving everyone here a sum of Rs. 20,000 for his land.” “Your names and the amount you are to receive have been written here and each of you will have to give his signature next to his name. If you are unable to write, your thumb print will be sufficient,” he continued. The people obliged and did as instructed, with every person receiving his share of the money. In Chungmoi, there was a person who was strictly against corruption. His name was, Mr. Awang. On learning about the method of the distribution of the compensation money, Mr. Awang had a hunch about it. He asked Mrs. Apoung who 3was one of the land owners who received the compensation about the matter. She (Mrs. Apoung) is a person who is very particular about things. Listening attentively to what Mrs. Apoung said, Mr. Awang adviced her to make an inquiry on the matter under Right To Information (RTI). Mrs. Apoung had never heard of the concept before. He told her the meaning and the workings of R.T.I. He explained to her that R.T.I (Right to Information), is a device which enabled citizens to have the necessary information on things done by the government to maintain transparency and curb corruption. He continued by telling her that 4whatever inquiry made, will be answered within a period of 30 days failure to which, the party under inquiry will be prosecuted. Nothing is kept secret from the public unless it is valuable information threatening National security. “Thank you. After hearing what you have said, I have a feeling that something is not right here. I will inform the others about it 5and we shall file an R.T.I inquiry with your help”, said Mrs. Apoung. Then the landowners of Chungmoi village went to the District Headquarter P.W.D Office and searched for the Public Information Officer (P.I.O). On finding him, they handed him the inquiry letter and the Rs. 10 fee. They were informed that it would take 30 days for them to receive the information. The appellate authority of the public authority shall dispose of the appeal within a period of thirty days or in exceptional cases within 45 days of the receipt of the appeal. After investigation, it was found out that the landowners got only half of the allotted money for their land compensation, and the money to be given each person also varied according to the size of land used for the construction site. Also, names of people who did not belong to the village were found 6written on the list which stated that they were paid the money. The amount sanctioned by the government was Rs. 5,00,000 but what the people of Chungmoi received was only Rs. 2,00,000 and that to the unknown names was Rs. 1,00,000. The missing Rs. 2,00,000 was not recorded. The government launched an investigation against the culprits of this misdemeanour. 7It was found that the P.W.D Minister pocketed Rs. 2,00,000. Their modus operandi was such that the minister called his subordinate officer and told him this, “For the Government work, Rs. 2,00,000 is required. Quickly send that money. The remaining Rs. 3,00,000, distributed as per your discretion.” Of the Rs. 5,00,000, the minister took Rs. 2,00,000, the land owners of Chungmoi received Rs. 2,00,000, and the remaining Rs. 1,00,000 was written off to the names of the people who were not residents of the village of Chungmoi. The S.D.O, their cashier and the Minister in charge where punished as per the law. All the money that they wrongfully took from the people, they were forced to repay the full amount and by the command of the court, all the people found guilty were put behind bars. 8After this, all the land owners of Chungmoi received the due amount which they were each allotted and each of them also upgraded from their thatch roof houses to houses with roofs made of tin. The widowed Mrs. Apoung received the largest amount of money. With that money, she constructed the biggest house in their village. ************* ********** ******* *** 9   \n",

Shillong, the 28th February, 2017. C E R T I F I C A T E This is to certify that the Law Department, Govenment of Meghalaya has vetted the Legal Literacy Materials consisting of 11 booklets and 11 folders in English Language. These material are found to be satisfactory and would be of immense use in disseminating legal awareness to the grassroots level in the State. Date: 28.02.2017 ( S.K. Sangma ) Under Secretary to the Govt. of Meghalaya, Law Department. ****The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 Shongmu was preparing her daughter Apoung for school. Apoung asked for money to pay her school fees. Shongmu went to her and asked him the required amount of money to pay the school fees. This enraged her husband. He started abusing and screaming at Shongmu and said, “Does money bloom in plants that I will pluck and bring to you? What great will we achieve by educating her so much? Teach her the daily 1household chores. They will be more useful to her. I don’t have extra money to waste. Go from here and start preparing my breakfast.” A couple of days later, Shongmu once again asked her husband some money to purchase some grocery items. To this, her husband replied, “You ask for money all the time. It seems you spend a lot of money. I remember that only a few days back, you took some money from me. Did you spend all of it? Your parents have not gifted me a big corpus of funds from which I can remit you money daily. God! In whose company have I fallen into?” Shongmu always had to rely on her husband for all her requirement, both small and big. Her husband always insulted her whenever she sought financial help. He abused her and harassed her mentally. He not only abused her but also her parents. 2One day, things went out of hand. Her husband was drunk when he returned home at night. Shongmu was setting the dinner table. Her husband became angry at the sight of the food and screamed at her, “What kind of food is this? I give you so much money to make purchases and yet you give me such kind of food.” 3With the mixture of anger and intoxication, he forcefully threw his dish from the table. The dish hit Shongmu and all her clothes were soiled with the food. To make matters worse, the dish hit her face and head. The impact was so great that she was injured and her head started to bleed. However, her husband was intoxicated; he did not notice what had happened. Instead he held her by her hair and started to physically abuse and manhandled her. He also threw her out of the house. 4Shongmu stood outside the house and pleaded with her husband to let her in. However, her husband did not let her in. Instead he said, “Go away from here. From today onwards you have no relation to this house.” Shongmu’s neighbour, Khumla noticed Shongmu in that condition and she took her to her home. She attended to her wounds and said, “How could you bear such atrocities? Are you going to live your entire life like this?” 5Shongmu replied, “Fate has this in store for me. I carry out all the household activities the whole day, but he treats me like his slave. My only duties are to prepare food for the family, washing clothes, sending the children to school and tend to all his needs.” Khumla said, “No, it is not like that. Yesterday, I went to the Anganwadi meeting. There one madam came. She said that a law has been enacted for women. That law is known as The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005. We will seek help under this law.” The next morning, Khumla took Shongmu to an official. The official is known as Protection Officer in all the places. Shongmu narrated all the past incidents and experiences through which she went through. The Protection Officer listened to her very carefully. The Protection Officer who was a lady said, “This law is made for women like you who are victim to such 6atrocities. As per this law, your husband will be called and we will make him understand. If he does not conform to what we say, then you can file a case against him. We will help you in every possible ways.” The lady Protection Officer handed over a form to Shongmu which is known as D.I.R. (Domestic Incident Report). This form contains the description of the types of 7violence against women. The victimised women should describe the type of violence that has taken place against her. In case the victimised woman is not educated, then the Protection Officer himself/herself reads the form to her so that she can describe the type of violence that she has undergone through.

What happened uncle?” “He has been telling the whole village that the government will now provide foodgrains to all the poor at affordable prices.” 1“Oh, really! Has he been saying all these? Then surely he has gone out of his mind. Can this really happen?” asked Takam. “Come on! Be happy that the government is providing us food at affordable rates. Where is the problem there?” enquired Sangtila. “Then let’s go and ask Prerak Awang of Adult Education Centre” replied uncle. After reaching the Adult Education Centre, Takam greeted Awang, “Hello 2brother Awang”. Awang greeted and said, “Hello. Why is it that all of you have come together to meet me today? “Brother Awang, we all have come here to enquire about the scheme related to foodgrains which the government has announced.” “Alright. Please take your seats and I shall explain everything about it to all of you. 3The government has introduced Food Security Scheme recently. This scheme has been introduced with the aim of providing nutritional and quality food to poor people so that they can live a healthy life.” Thereafter Takam asked, “What are the provisions of this scheme?” Awang replied, “Through this scheme, people will receive rice, wheat and coarse foodgrains at affordable and reasonable rates.” 4Sangtila then questioned Awang, “Are there any benefits for women in this scheme?” Awang nodded and answered, “Yes, women will also be benefited through this scheme. Pregnant and lactating women will receive special nutritional support. Even women who are the head of the family shall receive special privilege. As per the scheme, women will be considered to be the head of the family and the ration card will be issued in their names.” “Alright, where can we obtain this card from?” Takam asked. At this, Awang replied, “This card can be obtained from the Village Council or from the office of the Food Department.” “Where will the foodgrains be available?” Uncle questioned. 5Awang said, “The foodgrains will be available through Government Fair Price Shops.” “What will be the quantity of foodgrains that we all will be receiving?” Menang wondered. Awang then replied to her question, “Each family shall receive 35 kilograms of foodgrains.” After knowing about the scheme, uncle was quite happy and contented and said, “Thank you Awang, for providing us these vital and valuable information.

He had two acres of agricultural land beside the street, near the river. Near Likokba’s land, there was a land of Imlong, an affluent man of the village, which was located towards the back side of Likokba’s land. Likokba was married to Menang. He was blessed with a son named Awang and a 1daughter named Khumla. They all dwelled in a small hut erected on his agricultural land. Likokba’s daughter was about to get married for which he was in need of money. To seek financial help, he went to Imlong. He asked Imlong to lend him some money as a loan. Imlong agreed to provide the loan to Likokba at once. However, Imlong’s intentions were not right. He always wanted to grab Likokba’s land by any means so that his land will be connected with the street that runs beside Likokba’s land. Imlong considered this as a golden opportunity for him. He said to Likokba, “Likokba, I will provide you money, but you have to carry out the formalities in the government office.” Khumla’s marriage was in the next month and Likokba was in dire need of money. As Likokba was not educated, he believed Imlong and agreed to do what Imlong had said. 2Imlong lent the money to Likokba at the government office. He prepared some document and took Likokba’s thumb impression on the documents. Likokba’s daughter Khumla was married to Hopong. During that year, there was a good harvest of wheat in Likokba’s field. He sold his wheat in the wholesale market for farmer’s agricultural produce. The wheat was sold at good rate. Since Likokba had surplus money, he, along with his brother Mandok, went to Imlong to pay off the loan amount along with the interest. 3Likokba asked Imlong for the documents wherein he had put his thumb impression while taking the money. Imlong, deffered the matter and gave the excuse that he will have to search for the documents. He assured Likokba that he will return him the documents after finding them. As Likokba and Mandok were innocent and illiterate farmers, they believed Imlong and the matter was left there itself. Monsoon was soon approaching and time has come to till the soil once again. Likokba went to plough his field and sow the seeds for the upcoming season. When Likokba entered his field, he saw the servants of Imlong were standing on his field. When the servants saw Likokba, they did not allow Likokba to plough his field and chased him away from his land. Imlong’s servants then started sowing the seeds with the help of a tractor that belonged to 4Imlong. Likokba was perplexed and could not understand what was going on. He then approached Imlong to enquire about the matter. Likokba asked Imlong, “You have not returned me the documents where I put my thumb impression on, even though I had repaid the money that I borrowed from you. Now what are your servants doing in my land? Why are they sowing seeds in my land with your tractor?” Imlong replied in anger, “Likokba, you have sold your land to me. You are no longer 5the owner of the land. If you ever set foot on my land, I will kill you.” Likokba got scared at the threat of Imlong. He started crying and pleaded for mercy. With folded hands, Likokba said, “Soon after harvesting my crops and selling them, I had returned the money that I owed to you in front of Mandok as a witness. However, you had not returned the documents of the loan. Moreover, you have even tried to deviate from the matter. For God’s sake, please don’t be dishonest.” On hearing this Imlong furiously said, “Are you going to fight with me? Someone throw him out of my house.” Poor Likokba had no other option. He wept and cried and came back to his home. On his way, Likokba met the Village Council Chairman. On seeing Likokba crying, he enquired as to what the matter was. 6Likokba narrated the entire incident to the Village Council Chairman with tearful eyes. The Village Council Chairman listened to him very carefully. He regained Likokba’s composure and instilled courage in Likokba and said, “You need not worry. Have courage. The government has provided special facilities and rights to the people belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. People belonging to Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes will receive justice, free of cost, through special courts. You will get back your land and Imlong will be put behind bars.” 7The Village Council Chairman took Likokba to the police station where Likokba narrated the entire story. The policeman, after hearing from Likokba as to how his land has been snatched, said, “Wrongfully dispossessing a member of a Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe from his land by any person will be considered as an offence. Preparing fraud documents is a legal crime which leads to severe penalty or imprisonment. You lodge an FIR. Imlong will be punished for his misdoings.” The policeman further told Likokba, “The trial of your case will be in a special court. You don’t have to pay the legal charges and the lawyer’s fees. The Government of India has provided these facilities to the people belonging to Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes so that they can live their life with honour and dignity. As per this law, Imlong will not be granted bail. You will receive your farm land back. We will protect your land.” 8in his land and soon the seeds bloomed into abundant greenery. Likokba and his family were delighted to see the abundant crop in their field. They started living a normal and happy life. The police official who helped Likokba often comes and inquires about his daily state of affairs. He too was pleased that Likokba is now leading a normal life. 10The Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 People belonging to the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes have the right of equality in the society.

C E R T I F I C A T E This is to certify that the Law Department, Govenment of Meghalaya has vetted the Legal Literacy Materials consisting of 11 booklets and 11 folders in English Language.

Sangma ) Under Secretary to the Govt. of Meghalaya, Law Department. ****(Pongtang Gets Justice) Pongtang was a labourer in Noksen Village. His family comprised of his wife Sepila, daughter Shongmu and son Mandok. Pongtang’s aged father and mother also lived with him. Pongtang and Sepila used to work in farms to earn their family’s livelihood. A farmer named Hemyen lived in Pongtang’s neighbourhood. He had five acres of land in the village. He used to call Pongtang and Sepila for tending the crops. However, Pongtang and Sepila never went to work in Hemyen’s farm because Hemyen always looked at Sepila in an obscene and lewd manner, which made Sepila uncomfortable. Once, Pongtang and Sepila went to Hemyen’s farm to sow some seeds. While working, Hemyen sent Pongtang to fetch the plough from Hemyen’s house. At 1that moment Hemyen started teasing and taunting Sepila. From that i n c i d e n t o n w a r d s , Pongtang and Sepila stopped going to Hemyen’s farm for any kind of work. Due to this reason, Hemyen wanted to seek vengeance on them. One day, a rich man’s jewels were stolen in the village. The rich man lodged an FIR in the Police Station regarding the theft, after which the police started investigating the matter in the village. 2Hemyen wanted to take advantage of this situation. He planned to falsely accuse Pongtang of this theft so that when Pongtang is put behind bars, Sepila will approach him to seek help since the Sub-Divisional lawyer, Chaushak often visits Hemyen. During the course of their investigation when the police approached Hemyen, Hemyen said, “It is Pongtang who has stolen the jewels.” The police went to Pongtang’s House and found some of the stolen jewels in front of his house. The police confiscated the jewels and prepared a confiscation report. The police became suspicious of Pongtang. They searched the entire house of Pongtang but did not find anything. However, they arrested Pongtang. Following the arrest, Sepila and his aged parents became scared and anxious. Sepila said, “Who will save my husband from being imprisoned? We neither 3have money to spend nor to pay the fees of any lawyer.” Hearing the words of Sepila, her son Imlong said, “Mother, you need not worry. I have seen a board near the bus stand regarding free legal assistance and consultancy. There, two lawyers were talking to the Village Council Chairman. They were saying that the government has made provisions to provide justice to the poor 4villagers. Let us go to that office and try to free our father.” Hearing this, Sepila’s fear receded a bit. She went to the Free Legal Assistance and Consultancy Centre and met the lawyer. The next day, the police presented Pongtang in the court before the judge. The judge started interrogating Pongtang. Pongtang pleaded that he is innocent and that the theft was not carried out by him. He further said that he is falsely accused of the theft and the police forcefully arrested him. He and his family earn their livelihood by hard work and not by 5wrong means. He said that he has not stolen anything and the stolen items are not in his possession. The judge asked Pongtang, “Do you have a lawyer to fight for your case and provide you justice?” Pongtang replied, “We are poor and illiterate. How can we fight a case? We don’t have any money to pay for a lawyer. When will you set me free from the prison? I have to go for my daily work to run my family. The judge carefully listened to his words and then he said, “We will provide you a lawyer at the expense of the government.” The lawyer from the Free Legal Assistance and Consultancy Centre appeared before the judge. His wife Sepila and his son Mandok were also present with the lawyer. 6The lawyer immediately presented the papers for Pongtang’s bail. He told all the truth about the case to the judge and asked the judge to release him on bail. The judge approved the bail plea of Pongtang. 7Since the police filed a case against Pongtang, the lawyer from the Free Legal Assistance and Consultancy Centre fought for Pongtang. He finally argued that Pongtang is innocent. The stolen items were not recovered from him and the police also failed to present any witness or proof against Pongtang. Considering all the facts, proofs and witnesses of the case and the arguments of the lawyers, the judge passed the judgement that there is no proof against Pongtang and he should be set free.

C E R T I F I C A T E This is to certify that the Law Department, Govenment of Meghalaya has vetted the Legal Literacy Materials consisting of 11 booklets and 11 folders in English Language. These material are found to be satisfactory and would be of immense use in disseminating legal awareness to the grassroots level in the State. Date: 28.02.2017 ( S.K. Sangma ) Under Secretary to the Govt. of Meghalaya, Law Department. ****(Our Jungle – Our Trust) The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 and Rules 2008 Today a lot of people have been moving around in the village of Sanglao. Everyone is going towards the Village Council. People are expecting Chila, a female lawyer from 1the city. The Chairman of the Village Council is a gentleman by the name of Showba. He has been telling the people that the lawyer will be discussing about the Law of Forest Rights. This law has been enacted to protect the rights of the tribal people who dwell in forests. This law also covers the rights of other traditional forest dwellers. While Showba, the Chairman of the Village Council, has been talking about all these to the villagers, the lawyer, Chila arrived at the gathering of the village council. Everybody welcomed her with respect. Thereafter, Chila began her talk. She said, “All of you who have gathered here are Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Dwellers who have been dwelling in forests for centuries together. You all have always trusted and contibuted greatly towards the protection of the forests. The forest is your home and if your home does not get the 2appropriate rights, it will be a big injustice done to you all.” She continued, “Among you all were those tribes who had been compelled to forego their homes in the name of development and had to settle in some other place. Insecurity related to land has been a problem which has been continuing for a long time. To curb this menace, Forest Rights Act, 2006 and Rules 2008 have been framed.” All the forest dwellers present at 3the gathering were listening very carefully to Chila. Hopong said: “Madam Lawyer, what benefit will we get from this law?” Chila replied: “This is a valid question. In this Forest Rights Act, the Scheduled Tribes and other forest dwellers have been given some legal rights:  All tribal dwellers who have been residing in the forest earlier than 2005, shall receive land rights documents. 4 All other traditional forest dwellers who have been residing in the forest for three generations (seventy five years) will also receive land rights documents.  Right of ownership shall also be given for village, habitat and community forest land.” Imlong asked – “Are lands under community rights also included under this Law?” Chila replies – “Yes, rights of land under community rights will be given to forests dwellers as per rules of the State.  Forest rights will also be given to forest dwelling Schedules Tribes and other traditional forest dwellers on other community rights of uses or entitlements such as fish and other products of water bodies.  The forest dwelling Schedules Tribes and other traditional forest dwellers shall have 5the right of access to collect, use and dispose of minor forest produce such as bamboo, brush wood, stumps, cane, cocoons, honey, wax, lac, or leaves, medicinal plants and herbs, roots, tubers, stones, chips and the like.  Forest dwelling Scheduled Tribes and other traditional forest dwellers shall have the rights to transport the minor forest produce from the forest to villages and market through head loading, bicycle or hand cart.  No licences shall be issued on water bodies without the permission of the community.” Menang asked – “Can forest land be utilised for any other purpose?” Chila replied – “The Village Council has the right for diversion of forest land for the facilities like schools; dispensaries or hospital; anganwadis; fair price shops; 6tanks and other minor water bodies; electric lines, drinking water supply and water pipelines; roads; skill upgradation or vocational training centres; community centres. However, this should involve felling of trees not exceeding 75 trees.” Figure 1 7Lithrongla was listening quietly up till now. She also asked a question, “Who will have the right over the habitat of the tribal forest dwellers?” Chila replied – “The tribal forest dwellers will get the right of ownership over their habitat. They will have the rights of settlement and conversion of all forest villagers, old habitation, villages which are 8not surveyed and other villages in forests whether recorded, notified or not into revenue villages.” In today’s meeting, there are a lot of tribal people who were forcefully removed from their lands. Among them was Takam. He gathered courage and asked, ‘Can the tribal people who were displaced by the Forest Department come back and resettle in their own habitat?” Chila could understand the pain of Takam. She said, “If the tribal people are displaced before 13th December, 2005 by the Forest Department and if they have not been given compensation and they have not found a place to dwell, then they can resettle in their previous dwelling place. If the State plans to undertake certain developmental projects and as a consequence they need to acquire forest lands, the developmental project should kick 9start in the acquired forest land within five years of acquirement.
